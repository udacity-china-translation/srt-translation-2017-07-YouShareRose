1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,810
In the first case, you can't figure out
whether you're carrying all the products

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,160
users need by running an A/B test.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,070
You could try carrying a specific
additional product, but if users don't

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,710
buy it, you still won't know if there's
a different product you're missing.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,860
Instead, you might want to try asking
users whether there's anything

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,200
they feel is missing.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,310
In the second case, you wouldn't be
able to fully test whether the premium

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,590
service is a good business
decision using A/B testing.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,930
Users have to opt into
a premium service, so

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,295
randomly assigning people to one group
or another wouldn't really work.

11
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:33,635
You wouldn't have a control
to compare against.

12
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:37,185
You can still get valuable
information from an A/B test.

13
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:37,825
For example,

14
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:40,785
you could see how many users will
read about the additional features or

15
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:43,715
how many will choose to upgrade
if you make the choice available.

16
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:46,185
But you can't fully test out the change.

17
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:49,149
The third case is a great
place to use A/B testing.

18
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,860
There are clear control and
experiment groups, the old algorithm and

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,070
the new algorithm.

20
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,080
There are also probably some clear
metrics you could use to evaluate

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,290
the change, such as the probability of
a user clicking on a recommendation or

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,800
actually watching the movie.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,860
The fourth case may be tricky to test,
depending on whether you have

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,340
the computing ability to run both
versions of the backend at once.

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,940
If you do though, you can definitely
A/B test the results of the change.

26
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,530
Once again, you have clear control and

27
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,340
experiment groups since
the groups are very comparable.

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,230
So, as long as you have
the computing power to

29
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,020
run both simultaneously, you're good.
