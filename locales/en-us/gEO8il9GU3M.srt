1
00:00:00,138 --> 00:00:03,378
>> We've just seen some examples of
metrics that are difficult to measure

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,786
directly or even impossible.

3
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:07,371
You said, there are some other
techniques we can use here, right?

4
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:09,568
>> Right.
And these techniques are actually useful

5
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:11,805
for generating new ideas for
metrics, as well.

6
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:13,073
And so they're useful for

7
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:16,586
both the new ideas, as well as digging
deeper into a user experience than

8
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:19,137
what your existing metrics
might be able to get you.

9
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:20,813
>> Great.
So what are these techniques?

10
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:21,908
>> There's a lot of techniques.

11
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:26,852
This ranges from surveys to
retrospective analyses, to focus groups.

12
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:30,310
These techniques can be used for
both brainstorming new metrics,

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,479
as well as validating possible metrics.

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,512
Now we briefly mentioned several of
these techniques back in lesson one,

15
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:40,610
but here we're going to be focusing on
how to use these techniques to generate

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,924
ideas for new metrics.

17
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:45,768
Now we're only going to discuss them
very briefly, there are details for

18
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:49,035
all of what we're going to be
talking about in a PDF linked off of

19
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:50,525
the Instructor's Notes.

20
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,983
>> So
let's talk first about external data.

21
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:57,064
So when you're looking for external data
that's going to help you to define and

22
00:00:57,064 --> 00:01:01,145
validate metrics, the first thing that
you can come across is companies that

23
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:05,603
actually collect fairly granular data of
that market share vertical such as how

24
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:10,028
many people are interested in the travel
industry and even for specific websites.

25
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,628
They may have visitor data
that the put together.

26
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:15,511
So these are companies that just,
comScore, Nielsen,

27
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:18,643
there's a few others and
they all use different techniques.

28
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:22,531
So the second type of company that'll
also have data you might find useful

29
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:24,925
are those that actually
run surveys of user.

30
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:28,041
So these would be companies,
such a Pew or Forrester,

31
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,770
they may ask users how
many devices do you have?

32
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,485
How much time do you spend
on them in a given day?

33
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:35,673
So depending on what you're looking for,

34
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:39,378
you may be able to either get these
types of data from a source your company

35
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:42,599
already has that they may have
marketing or for other reasons or

36
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,728
sometimes you can even get
the results published on the web.

37
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,402
The third category is what
I'll call academic research,

38
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,265
although it's a bit broader than that.

39
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:53,608
And these are papers that actually
try to establish metrics.

40
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,818
They may run correlation studies.

41
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:58,367
They may have very similar results to,
you know,

42
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,375
how much attention people are paying.

43
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:04,166
So something like eye tracking where you
may actually be able to find a study

44
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,654
where they had a bunch of people in
a lab and they look at how people read

45
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:11,504
a page and they actually collect, you
know, how much reading are they doing

46
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:14,031
versus how much time do
their eyes spend on the page

47
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:17,973
versus how long did it take them to
actually click-through to the next page.

48
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:20,488
So you may be able to
find data you need or

49
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:23,553
you may be able to find
something very similar.

50
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:26,450
So normally, you can use these
in multiple ways as Diane said.

51
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,505
First of all, they're great for
brainstorming.

52
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,968
They help you think of new metric ideas.

53
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:35,577
The second is they're good for
validating metrics, where you can

54
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:39,842
actually say, you know, on my site, I
think I get this many visitors per day.

55
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:41,662
But when I look at my whole industry,

56
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,435
it looks completely out of
whack with what I'm seeing.

57
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:48,322
So these can help you establish
that your own tracking for users or

58
00:02:48,322 --> 00:02:51,865
other sort of aggregate metrics is,
is actually working.

59
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:55,257
And then the third thing is they can
actually help you develop validation

60
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:55,932
techniques.

61
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:59,180
So, if you see that study about eye
tracking you can look at how they

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,544
analyze their data and maybe you have
other data that you could use and

63
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:05,575
you could analyze it in the same
way to validate your metrics.

64
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:07,270
So they've a lot of different uses.
