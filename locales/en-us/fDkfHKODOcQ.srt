00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,290
Okay, we expect clickthrough probability
to follow a binomial distribution, but

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,860
how do we actually use this to decide
which values should surprise us?

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,220
>> Well, the benefit of knowing that it
should follow binomial distribution is

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,770
that we can use the formula we have for
sample standard error for the binomial

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,730
to estimate how variable we expect our
overall probability of a click to be.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,970
What that means is that for
a 95% confidence interval,

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,410
which is commonly what you hear people
talk about, if we theoretically repeated

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,300
the experiment over and over again, we
would expect the interval we construct

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,060
around our sample mean to cover the true
value in the population 95% of the time.
