1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,390
Okay, so we've got a few different
types of metrics we're interested in.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,790
There's the sanity checking metrics and
then there's the evaluation metrics,

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,850
which breaks down into these overall
business metrics and the more detailed

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,470
metrics, but for all of these, how do we
actually go about making a definition?

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,960
>> Well, there's really
a bunch of different steps.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,590
The first is you want to come up with
a high level concept for a metric.

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,260
This is going to be your one sentence
summary that everyone is going to be

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,270
able to understand,
something like "active users" or

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,200
"click-through probability".

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,070
Everyone sort of understands that.

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,080
But then, from there,

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,110
the second step is to really figure
out all of the nitty gritty details.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,010
These are going to be things like,
okay, you want to measure active users.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,780
How do you define what active is?

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,520
Is it a seven day active,
is it a 28 day active?

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,200
Which events count towards activity?

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,700
Right?
An automatic notification may not count

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,635
towards it being an active user.

19
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,655
The third step is that you are taking
all of these individual data

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,980
measurements, and now you need to
summarize them into a single metric.

21
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,905
Maybe, maybe this is something like
a sum or a count, could be an average,

22
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:02,440
a median.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,251
We'll go through bunch of
these possibilities later.

24
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,373
Once you have that summary, now you have
an actual complete metric definition,

25
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:12,948
and now that you go into all of the
other steps that Kerry talked about in

26
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,450
the introduction.

27
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,990
Okay.
But before we get into that,

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,170
I have one more question.

29
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,880
It sounds like for sanity checking,
you might need multiple metrics.

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,610
But how about for evaluation?

31
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,830
Should you stick to just one metric
there, or do you also use multiple?

32
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,000
>> It may depend culturally on
the company and where you are, and

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,140
how comfortable people
are with the data.

34
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,970
You can certainly pick one metric and
some companies do,

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,930
but at the same time, you know, your
leaders may be more comfortable with

36
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,460
a whole suite of metrics where
they can see how things move.

37
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,440
Now for PR purposes, external reporting,
you may really have to settle on

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,800
a single overall objective
that you have for the company.

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,100
And certainly if you work at a large
company, you have the problem that

40
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,650
you don't want to have one team
working towards one goal and

41
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,750
another team working
towards another one.

42
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,560
And so you may, in that case, also
want to settle on a single objective.

43
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,140
>> Now, one thing that you can do
is if you have multiple metrics,

44
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,270
you can create a composite metric.

45
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,830
This can be something called
an objective function or an OEC,

46
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,050
which is, stands for
an overall evaluation criterion,

47
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,650
which is a term that Microsoft uses for
when they come up with a weighted

48
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,570
function that combines all
of these different metrics.

49
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,330
So when you do that,
you now have a single combined metric

50
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,620
that summarizes all your
individual metrics.

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,580
>> Now personally, I tend to shy
away from composite metrics,

52
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,880
because of course,
first you have to agree on a definition.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,470
And getting everyone to agree to
a combination of revenue and users and

54
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,730
all this other stuff can be very tricky.

55
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,290
I mean, it's hard to define.

56
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,460
The second is you can run into
problems if you over-optimize,

57
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,820
looking at one thing, and you don't
actually look at how other things move,

58
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,270
particularly if you, if you make
a radical change to your site.

59
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,170
And then, the third is issue is
just that the moment this metric

60
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,590
starts to move, everyone who askz you to
have a single metric typically comes and

61
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,290
says well, why is it moving?

62
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,940
And you end up looking at all
these different things, anyway.

63
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,170
>> Yeah, you basically go right back
looking at all the individual metrics.

64
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,249
I agree with Carrie.

65
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:09,833
Now, the last situation that you'll
sort of think about when you're trying

66
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,160
to choose a metric is how generally
applicable the metric is.

67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,180
If you're running a whole suite of AB
tests, then ideally you'd have one or

68
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,530
more metrics that you can
use across the entire suite.

69
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,670
It's much better to use a metric
that's less optimal for

70
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,790
your test, if you can use it across the
suites that you can do the comparison,

71
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,170
than it is to come up with
the perfect metric for your test.

72
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,720
Whenever you do something custom,
it just introduces more risk.

73
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,790
>> That makes sense.

74
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,640
Now let's get started by coming up with
some high-level concepts for metrics.
