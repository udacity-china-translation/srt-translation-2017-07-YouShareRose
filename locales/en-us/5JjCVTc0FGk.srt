1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,000
Let's wrap up.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,360
What are the main things we've learned?

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,990
>> First you need to check.

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,890
Double check, triple check that your
experiment was set up properly.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,320
Look at your end variance.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,090
Check that your experiment metrics
are actually looking sane.

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,190
Right, you have to check that before
you try and do anything else.

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,120
>> And remember you aren't just
looking for statistical significance.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,380
You're really making
a business decision.

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,940
So what if you have an experiment that
statistically significantly improves

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,330
the experience for 30% of users but
it's neutral for everyone else.

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,600
Do you necessarily want
to launch it as it is or

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,479
do you want to try to make it better.

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,800
And what if you're in a situation
where it improves things for 70% but

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
makes it worse for 30%.

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,450
So you actually need to make a decision
about whether you want to launch

17
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,220
the feature as it is, or if you
want to try to fine tune it first.

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,410
>> And you can't actually forget
the overall business analysis as well.

19
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,750
For example, what's the engineering
cost of maintaining the change?

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,770
Are there customer support or
sales issues?

21
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,230
Overall what's the opportunity cost if
you actually choose to launch the change

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,960
relative to the rewards you're going
to get from from the change or

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,920
potentially not launching the change?

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,080
This is all about the judgment
call with regards to

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,290
the user experience and the business.

26
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,923
And ultimately that's what your
commission has to be based on.

27
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:14,460
>> That makes sense,
any other last thoughts?

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,664
>> Well, if you haven't actually tested
your change on all traffic, even if it

29
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:23,075
only impacts a small slice, now's a good
time to test for that incidental impact.

30
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:26,040
>> Yeah and
if this is the first experiment you run,

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,980
especially if it's a really big or
important feature,

32
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,050
you might want to actually try running
a couple of different experiments.

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,980
Analyzing the results and then seeing
how you feel about the results of

34
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,100
your first experiment before
you decide to launch it.
