1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,250
Let's say I've settled
on a bunch of metrics.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,570
How do I actually make a recommendation?

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,450
>> So especially when you have multiple
metrics, it can be a little bit

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,770
tricky because you have multiple
comparisons or things along those lines.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,720
Now what you're really hoping for

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,700
is that related metrics are all
going to move in the same direction.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,900
For example, if you're measuring
both click-through rate and

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,790
click-through probability, hopefully
they'll move in the same direction.

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,760
Another thing might happen when you
have a composite metric for example.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,670
RPM which is revenue
per thousand queries.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,650
Is composed of both click through rate.

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,160
As well as cost per clicks and
so if you see.

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,640
RPM of them one direction.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,410
Hopefully you can look at click through
rate in cost per click to understand

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,110
why it moved in that direction.

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,070
Now that said,
multiple metrics can be unruly.

17
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,750
Let's say you've decided that
reading time on the page or

18
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,000
stay time is a good signal.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,330
People like your page.

20
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,440
But clicks are also a good signal.

21
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,870
And so then you might see that when
you make a UI change to the page

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,980
people spend less time reading,
but more time clicking.

23
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,240
And then you really have to understand
how people are reacting to the change

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,360
because you can't quantitatively
evaluate which one is better.

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,239
That makes sense.

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,390
I'm guessing that's why sometimes
people want to single overall

27
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,770
evaluation criteria, so they can
make the decision based on that?

28
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,680
>> That's right.

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,880
I think the main question when you
try and come up with an OEC, or

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,350
an overall evaluation criteria,
is how do you find a good one?

31
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,950
You really need to understand
what your company is doing and

32
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,050
what the problems are in order
to try and come up with saying.

33
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,380
Ok well how do I balance for

34
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,490
example state time and clicks is it
seventy percent and thirty percent.

35
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,110
Is it twenty five and seventy-five.

36
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,430
Who knows or maybe.

37
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,300
Quite frankly.

38
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,030
Clicks is a bad measure for.

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,960
User experience.

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,320
On your web site all together.

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,100
Right you really have to understand.

42
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,930
The thing about an OEC is that it
doesn't absolve you of understanding why

43
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,100
stay time and clicks are moving
in these different directions.

44
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,620
What it can be helpful with
this balancing long term

45
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,420
investment like return
visits to the site

46
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,720
with short term day to day
metrics like increased clicks.

47
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,710
You don't want to lose one
in pursuing the other one.

48
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,870
And so often the best OICs give you
a good balance between those two things.

49
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,810
>> Okay.
And how do you come up with one?

50
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,500
>> Well typically there's a lot
of validation in the process but

51
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,538
they usually start with some kind
of business analysis right so

52
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,840
you might
>> Our company, as a whole,

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,060
wants to look at 25% revenue plus
75% increase usage of the site.

54
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,450
So usually you start from there.

55
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,100
And once you have
a couple of candidates,

56
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,030
you want to actually run a whole
bunch of different experiments.

57
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,760
And validate how they steer you.

58
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,480
You know, are they steering
you in the right direction.

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,090
Now the downside is you want to make
sure that you don't plan so much around

60
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,380
what the company thinks should happen
with those experiments that you steer

61
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,030
yourself in a way that you hide other
changes that you weren't expecting.

62
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,780
>> At Google we didn't
up doing a little bit.

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,440
Bit differently.

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,290
We actually took hundreds of
experiments that we had already run and

65
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,990
we had made launch decisions about.

66
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,570
And we got all of the decision
makers into a room and

67
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,490
we gave them all of those
experiment results.

68
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,780
We didn't tell them what
the experiment was testing.

69
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,670
And we didn't give them
the actual launch decision.

70
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,760
And we made them re-decide based
solely on the experiment results

71
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,670
whether they would launch change or not.

72
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,710
From there we could say ok well.

73
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,760
How much did each of you
agree with each other and

74
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,140
how did you agree with
the actual launch decision, and

75
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,330
using that we actually re-derived
the weights for an OAC.

76
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,230
Now for us, we came up with an OAC
that way, but whenever we tried using

77
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,510
it to make a launch decision
everyone sort of look at the OAC and

78
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,140
then be like, what were the individual
metrics that actually changed.

79
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,270
So we never actually ended up using
the OIC to actually make a decision.

80
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,810
Now what the sort of tells us is that

81
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,920
having an OIC doesn't have
to be a formal number.

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,200
It's really just trying to encapsulate
what your company cares about.

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,530
And how much you're going to be
balancing something like stay time

84
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,070
and clicks.
