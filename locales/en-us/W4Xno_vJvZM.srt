00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,780
Like Diane said a unit of diversion is
how we define what an individual subject

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,570
is in the experiment.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,200
There are three commonly used
categories of unit of diversion.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,982
The first two a user identifier and
an anonymous identifier are different

5
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:16,361
approximations for
an actual user or person.

6
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:18,492
And the last is just the single event.

7
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:20,326
Let's dive into each of these.

8
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:23,695
A user identifier is what most
people think of first for

9
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:26,290
running an experiment on.

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,120
This would be something like the login
that people create on websites or apps.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,608
For example, your email address
if you log into Facebook or

12
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:37,740
Amazon, or your username,
if create a username instead.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,070
While a person could have more
than one login, typically a login

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,390
is a pretty good proxy for a user and
it's stable and unchanging.

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,560
If you use a user id as your unit of
diversion, what that means is that all

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,040
the events correspond to the same used
id are either in the control group or

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,460
the experiment group, but they
are not mixed between the two groups.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,140
Whether the user is using
an app on their phone,

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,720
visiting the website on their phone, or

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,480
visiting the website on their desktop
computer, it's a consistent experience.

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,730
However, it's worth noting that
a user id is considered personally

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,220
identifiable.

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,350
Some sites use your email
address as your login and for

24
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,730
sites where you create a username many
people use some variation on their name.

25
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,870
And either way the site will typically
associate some other information with

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,490
the account, such as the user's
email address or phone number,

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,430
to help with account recovery.

28
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,270
An anonymous id is usually
something like a cookie.

29
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,410
On most websites, whenever a user visits
the website, it will write a cookie,

30
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,835
which is usually an anonymous random
identifier to a file on that device.

31
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:40,880
The cookie is specific to a browser and
a device though.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,780
If the users switches from
Chrome to Firefox, or if

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,490
they switch from their laptop to their
phone, they'll get a different cookie.

34
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,030
Users can also choose to clear their
cookies, in which case the next time

35
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,510
they visit the website they'll
get assigned a new one.

36
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,350
It's also possible to set your
preferences such that every time you

37
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,580
close your browser, all your
cookies are cleared automatically.

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,260
In other words, it's much easier for
a person to change their cookie

39
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,490
than it is for a person to change or
clear an account, ie a user identifier.

40
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,180
Apps on mobile devices can also
use a similar cookie mechanism.

41
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,540
Although it can be a bit more cumbersome
to clear a cookie on a mobile device or

42
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,582
for an app than it is in a browser.

43
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:19,880
Finally, event-based diversion
means that on every single event,

44
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,290
you redecide whether that event is
in the experiment or in the control.

45
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,560
This means that a user may not get
a consistent experience at all, so

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,708
this is only appropriate in situations
where the changes are not user visible.

47
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,600
For example, if you have a ranked list,

48
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,525
changes to the order of the list
would fall in this category.

49
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:38,165
Most users can't tell or won't notice.

50
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:41,045
There are also a couple of other
less commonly used options for

51
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,655
unit of diversion.

52
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:46,065
On mobile devices only, there's
an option called a device id that's

53
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,655
in between a cookie and a user ID.

54
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:50,402
The device device id is
typically something that's

55
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:54,042
tied to a specific device, and
it's unchangeable by the user.

56
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:57,042
It's also considered identifiable
because it's immutable.

57
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,852
But it doesn't have the cross device or

58
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:02,567
cross platform consistency that
the user identifier might have.

59
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:05,362
Another option is to divert
based on IP address, so

60
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:09,310
that any event with the same IP
address will be put in the same group.

61
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,280
If the user changes location,
then they often get a new IP address.

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,320
To make sure all this is clear,
I'll go through an example.

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,700
Imagine you have a user who does
the following sequence of events.

64
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,350
They're on desktop, not signed in,
and they visit the homepage.

65
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,030
They've also cleared
their cookies recently.

66
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,150
So they're not automatically signed in.

67
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,410
So, they sign in again,
then they visit a class,

68
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,890
and then they start watching a video.

69
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,040
After that video, we don't see
the user again for a while, but

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,410
then they pop up on their mobile phone
where they're automatically signed in

71
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,250
because the login is saved.

72
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,590
Then they continue watching the video
from where they stopped last.

73
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,150
Now suppose you're running
an experiment that would affect

74
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,850
each of these different pages.

75
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,110
For example, maybe you changed
something about the navigation bar and

76
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,790
it shows up on every page.

77
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,450
For each of the different units of
diversion we've talked about, user-id,

78
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,970
cookie, event, device id and

79
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,420
IP address, when would the user be
assigned to the same group as before and

80
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,670
when could they potentially be
switched to the other group?

81
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,590
That is, the experimental group if they
were in the control and vice-versa.

82
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,670
For each case,
check the box at the point or points,

83
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,570
where the user could be switched from
the experiment to control or vice-versa,

84
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,740
including the first time that
they are assigned to a group.

85
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,440
For the IP address diversion, you don't
haven't enough information to answer.

86
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,320
Clearly, they'll be assigned to
a group when they first visit, but

87
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,280
after that their IP Address
could change at any point and

88
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,000
if it does, they could be reassigned.
