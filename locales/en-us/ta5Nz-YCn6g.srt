1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,340
Our baseline conversion rate is 10%.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,940
That is 100 divided by 1,000.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,620
And the minimum detectable effect,
or practical significance boundary,

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,540
we decided was 2%, and
that's an absolute change.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,840
Finally, I'll make sure that 1 minus
theta is 80 Percent and alpha is 5%.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,850
This gives the answer that we'll need
at least 3623 page views per branch or

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,380
group of the experiment.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,210
So the correct answer is 3623.
