1
00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:04,168
The first change would almost certainly
reduce the number of pageviews needed.

2
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:07,837
By changing the unit of diversion to
be the same as the unit of analysis,

3
00:00:07,837 --> 00:00:10,774
the variability of the metric
will probably decrease and

4
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:12,815
be closer to the analytical estimate.

5
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:14,822
By decreasing the variability
of the metric,

6
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:18,223
you decrease the number of pageviews you
need to be confident in your results.

7
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:21,653
The main question here is whether
the less consistent experience will be

8
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:22,333
acceptable.

9
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:26,843
In this case, if audacity recalculated
the empirical estimate of the standard

10
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:30,612
error using the pageview as the unit
of diversion, they might find

11
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:34,675
that the new standard error was
0.0209 for the same sample size.

12
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:38,476
Then only 34,000 pageviews
per group would be necessary,

13
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,351
which is quite an improvement.

14
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:43,760
Targeting the experiment to English
traffic will also reduce the total

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,192
number of pageviews needed.

16
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:47,606
Since the non-English
traffic is not effected,

17
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:50,366
including it will dilute
the results of the experiment,

18
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:53,023
which would increase the number
of pageviews needed.

19
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:53,644
Of course,

20
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:57,563
there are fewer non-English page views
available than total page views.

21
00:00:57,563 --> 00:01:00,665
So this might not reduce
the time frame of the experiment,

22
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:04,983
but other experiments could be run on
the non-English traffic in the meantime.

23
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,001
So this could still be worth doing.

24
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:10,632
Filtering the traffic could also impact
your choice of practical significance

25
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:11,180
boundary.

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,137
First, since you're only looking
at a subset of your traffic,

27
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:17,171
you might need a bigger change
before it matters to the business.

28
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:19,618
Or since your variability
is probably lower,

29
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:21,876
you might want to take
advantage of that and

30
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:25,909
detect smaller changes rather than
decreasing the size of the experiment.

31
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,735
Because the practical significance
boundary could move in either direction,

32
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:32,142
your size could really
move in either direction.

33
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:35,861
But it's likely that the variance will
go down and the practical significance

34
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:39,317
boundary will increase, so it's
likely that the size will be smaller.

35
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:43,515
In this case, suppose that audacity
keeps pageviews as the unit of diversion

36
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:47,132
and then targeting the experiment
to English only traffic further

37
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,667
reduces the standard error to 0.0188.

38
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:54,524
And they also decide to increase their
practical significance boundary to 0.015

39
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:56,262
for the English traffic only.

40
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:59,884
At this point, they would only
need 12,000 pageviews per group.

41
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:03,366
The third change, changing the metric,
depends on the specific definition.

42
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:06,923
But it will often not make a significant
difference to the variability,

43
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:10,377
especially if you're using a short
time window for the probability.

44
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:13,444
If there is a difference,
the variability will probably go down.

45
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:16,951
Since the unit of analysis would be
the same as the unit of diversion in

46
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:17,564
this case.

47
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:21,034
So this could reduce the number
of pageviews needed, but

48
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,778
it also might not help much.

49
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:25,331
Again, I did these two
sizing calculations with

50
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:28,160
code linked in the Instructor's Notes,
if you're curious.
