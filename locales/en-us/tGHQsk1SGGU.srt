1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,850
Which of the following experiments might
require additional ethical review?

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,820
Specifically consider the data
that would need to be collected in

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,100
each experiment.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,660
For the first experiment,

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,040
Audacity currently asks users if
they would like to receive a monthly

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,190
newsletter as soon as they finish
the first lesson of a course.

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,480
They want to test instead asking
users about the newsletter

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,300
as soon as they start the course.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,890
The diversion is based on user ID.

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,670
The second experiment is similar, but

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,360
now Audacity wants to test moving the
newsletter prompt to as soon as a user

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,900
views details about
any particular course.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,100
Since this may happen before
a user has created an account,

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,030
the diversion is based on
cookie rather than user ID.

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,230
And users who do not have an account yet
are asked for their email address,

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,280
if they wish to receive the newsletter.

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,620
In the third experiment,

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,200
Audacity changes some of the information
on a course overview page, and

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,110
measures the click through
probability on the enroll button.

20
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,580
Again, since users can view the course
overview page without having an account,

21
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,180
Audacity uses cookie based diversion.

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,160
In each case, check the box if
you think the experiment would

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,489
require additional ethical review.
