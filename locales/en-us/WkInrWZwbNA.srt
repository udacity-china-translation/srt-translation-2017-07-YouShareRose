1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,300
Okay, so we've designed and
sized the experiment.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,100
Now, let's assume that we've run it and
analyzed the results of the experiment.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,398
Suppose the control group had
10,072 total page views, and

4
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:14,092
the experimental group had 9,886.

5
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:17,594
These numbers aren't exactly the same
because of how people were randomly

6
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:18,601
assigned to groups.

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:23,337
In the control group 974 of those users
clicked the Start Now button, and

8
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:26,080
in the experimental group, 1242 did.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,860
So, it certainly looks like more people
clicked in the experimental group, but

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,220
was this due to random variation?

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,920
To answer that, we'll need to
calculate the confidence interval for

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,200
the difference.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,820
I'll start by calculating
the pooled probability,

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,370
that is the total number
of clicks in both groups,

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,450
divided by the total number of users,
and that comes to about 0.111.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,630
Next, I'll calculate the pool to
standard error using the formula you

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,459
saw before, and
this comes to about 0.00445.

18
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:58,620
Now, go ahead and
finish the calculation,

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,730
by calculating the estimated difference,
or d hat, and the margin of error, or m.

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,320
Write your answers in these
boxes to four decimal places.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,880
Then, put the upper and lower bounds of
the confidence interval in these boxes,

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,820
also to four decimal places.

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,980
Finally, would you launch the new
version of the Start Now button based on

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,820
these results?

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,300
Select yes or no.

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,238
Don't forget to consider whether
the change is greater than the practical

27
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:25,810
significance level of 2%, and
use the 95% confidence level.
