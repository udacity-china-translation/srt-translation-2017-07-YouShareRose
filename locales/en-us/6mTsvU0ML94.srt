1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,150
There are three common techniques
you can use to gather additional

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,880
data about your users.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,470
They vary along two major axes.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,600
Some give more in-depth customized data.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,650
But others will be possible to run on
a greater total number of participants.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,330
The first is called user
experience research, or UER.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,840
Here, you can go really
deep with just a few users,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,430
often by observing them
doing tasks of interest,

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,660
like taking a lesson of a course
as well as asking them questions.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,439
You get a lot of detailed and in-depth
information that is useful primarily for

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,900
brainstorming ideas, anything from
coming up with ideas to changes to

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,810
tests, to identifying problems with your
user experience in a way that you can

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,120
translate into a possible metric that
you could use to evaluate your A/B test.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,060
You can also use special
equipment in a UER

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,090
to get information that you
couldn't get from your site's data.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,780
For example, you could use a special
camera that tracks eye movement

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,720
to see what users are looking at,
even if they don't click or

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,060
otherwise interact with the page.

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,900
However, you'll want to make sure that
you validate the results of a UER with

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,800
something like the retrospective
analyses Carrie talked about.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,720
The second method is
called focus groups.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,760
With focus groups, you bring a bunch of
users or potential users together for

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,330
a group discussion.

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,780
You can talk to more total users
than with a UER study, but

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,290
you can't go as deep with each person.

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,080
Once you bring the users together,
you could show them screen shots or

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,740
images, you could walk
them through a demo, and

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,920
then you can ask them
questions to elicit feedback.

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,590
You can also often ask
hypothetical questions, but

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,470
even if you have a skilled facilitator,
you run the risk of group think and

31
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,680
convergence on fewer opinions.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,490
Have you ever been in a room and there's
been a few loud voices that dominate?

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,520
That same dynamic can
occur in focus groups.

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,350
Third, surveys are when you
recruit a population and

35
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,590
ask them a bunch of questions, either
online, or in person, or via telephone.

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,000
Surveys are pretty cheap to run
on a whole bunch of users, and

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,700
the data you get is much more
quantitative, but it's not very deep or

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,870
individually customized.

39
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,240
Surveys are useful for gathering metrics
that you cannot directly measure

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,300
yourself, such as the question about
how many students who take audacity

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,760
classes get jobs, how productive
they are at their job, and

42
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,600
whether the classes
contributed to their success.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,250
That said,
be careful with survey results.

44
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,960
Users don't have to tell the truth, and

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,060
their answers can be dependent on
how the questions are phrased.

46
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,820
Because of this, you can almost never
directly compare survey results

47
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,810
to results computed using
more observational methods.

48
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,670
There are more details
about these methods,

49
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,810
as well as some other techniques, in the
PDF linked in the instructor's notes.
