1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,790
The census data is not sensitive.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,710
On one hand, gender and
age are protected data and

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,710
considered sensitive, however,
the data being discussed is aggregated

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,150
to a granularity that does not allow for
re-identification of individuals.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,420
As such, storing and

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,440
analyzing it on your own servers
does not carry any privacy concerns.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,730
The data about how many people visit
various web sites is also not sensitive,

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,330
even if it's for
a health site or a porn site.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,770
There's no way to tell who is visiting
the sites based on this data.

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,800
You're only collecting
the total number of visitors.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,038
The glucose data could potentially be
sensitive, even though it's anonymous.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,520
The exact timestamps could be enough
information to link the data to

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,840
a specific person in some
extreme circumstances.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,920
It's pretty unlikely that anyone
would actually be able to do this,

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,150
even if it were theoretically possible.

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,410
But glucose levels
are private health data, so

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,680
it's important to be extra safe.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,190
Health data is subject to additional
regulation, such as HIPAA

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,500
which specifies that timestamps
are considered personally identifiable.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Certainly if the ID you store with
the data is not actually anonymous and

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,700
is possible to recover a name,
an email address, or

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,390
a phone number from it,
then this would be sensitive data.

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,360
The game data is not sensitive.

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,370
Again, it's possible that you could
recover the person's identity from

25
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,620
details such as the time stamps, but
that's not a very likely outcome.

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,480
Moreover, since game data is not
sensitive, even if someone could recover

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,410
the details, that would be low risk for
the participant.

28
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,040
The sales data for
the shopping site broken down by zip

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,110
code is not sensitive, because
the totals are stored for a zip code.

30
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,770
Typically, a zip code has enough
individuals active in that area that

31
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,250
information in that level of granularity
does not have a re-identification risk.

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,640
A better guideline, though,
rather than using zip code,

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,780
would be to ensure that there are enough
data points to guarantee that the data

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,870
is sufficiently anonymized.

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,900
The credit card data is
definitely sensitive

36
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,590
If you entered your credit card
number on a shopping site,

37
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,630
you would definitely expect that site
to be storing the data securely.
