1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,380
To calculate the global pool to standard
error, I'll first need to calculate

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,970
the number of users into the number
of clicks in the control and

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,900
experiment groups globally by adding up
the New Zealand data with the other data

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,430
which gives these results.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,540
Then I can calculate
the pooled probability and

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,460
the pooled standard error which
come out to 0.051 and 0.0013.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,540
Recall that for New Zealand,

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,505
the pooled error was 0.0042 which
is about four times as large.

9
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:30,190
In this case the variability
of the global data

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,900
as measured by the pooled standard
error is lower than the filtered data.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,970
Mostly because there is so
much more data globally.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,190
This will often be the case in practice.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,770
But it's also good to keep in mind that,
in practice,

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,920
your data will actually be a mix of
different populations almost every time.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,890
When you filter,
you're going to get a smaller but

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,130
also more uniform population.

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,739
Which means that for
the same number of data points,

18
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,722
the variability of the filtered
data is likely to be lower.

19
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,985
In order to find whether the difference
was statistically significant we first

20
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:03,685
need to calculate the difference
which globally was 0.0013.

21
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:07,190
Then I'll construct a confidence
interval and see if it includes 0.

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,190
The margin of error will be the pooled
standard error times the z score

23
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,786
of 1.96 which comes to 0.0025.

24
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:17,097
Since the margin of error is wider
than the estimated difference,

25
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:19,233
the confidence interval will include 0.

26
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:21,873
Which means that this
difference is not significant.

27
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,435
Carrying out the same calculations for
the New Zealand data,

28
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:27,844
the difference observed is 0.012.

29
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:31,040
And the margin of error is 0.0082.

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,180
In this case, the margin of error is
smaller than the observed difference.

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,330
So the confidence interval
will not include 0.

32
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,650
And the results are significant.

33
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,420
Note that even though the New Zealand
only data had a higher variability, and

34
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,810
thus a wider margin of error,
or a wider confidence interval,

35
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,590
the New Zealand results were significant
whereas the global results were not,

36
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,700
because the observed difference was so

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,470
much higher in New Zealand,
0.012 versus 0.0013.

38
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,160
Adding all of the unaffected traffic
that was outside of New Zealand

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,230
diluted the difference
in the global data,

40
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,630
causing the result not
to be significant.

41
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,580
To summarize, the global pooled
standard error was 0.0013.

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,800
The New Zealand results
were significant.

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,160
And the global results were not.
