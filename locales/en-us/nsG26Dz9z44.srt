1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,650
In each of the following example
experiments, choose what

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,640
unit of diversion you think would be
needed to ensure enough consistency.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,060
That is, if a consistent user
experience is not necessary,

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,110
choose event level diversion.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,248
Otherwise, choose cookie diversion,
if that is consistent enough.

6
00:00:16,248 --> 00:00:20,020
And, choose user-id diversion
if that is necessary.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,270
First, suppose Audacity is testing a
change to the backend which would reduce

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,900
video load time by 100 milliseconds,
but it would be more expensive.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,340
They want to know whether the reduced
load time will be worth the money.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,390
What level of consistency
would they need in this case?

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,360
And second, suppose Audacity has placed
the button more prominently on the page

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,250
by changing the color and
increasing the size.

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,900
Third, suppose Audacity has a search bar
that lets students search for classes.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,990
And, they test changing the order in
which the search results are shown.

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,114
Finally, suppose Audacity notices
a low pass rate for some quizzes, and

16
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:56,744
they test adding additional
information to the instructor's

17
00:00:56,744 --> 00:01:00,294
notes below the videos before those
quizzes to see if this helps.

18
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,694
In each case, select what level of
consistency Audacity would need.
