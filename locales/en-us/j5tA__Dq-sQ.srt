00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,750
Like Diane and Carrie said,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,750
we first need to come up with the high
level concepts for our metrics.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,190
A good place to start is with
the overall business objective.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,270
And what Audacity ultimately cares
about is helping their students get

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,930
jobs in finance.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,720
Of course, they also need their
business to be financially sustainable.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,980
That is, they need to make money.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,240
We can break these objectives down
into steps using a customer funnel

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,040
like you saw in lesson one.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,460
At that point,
we put four steps into the funnel.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,700
How many users visit the homepage,
how many users explore the site further,

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,970
how many create an account, and
how many complete a course.

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,280
The idea is that each of these
is a step in the process

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,850
of either getting a job or
helping Audacity make money.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,040
In this case, because they might
use coaching at some point.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,400
This funnel is pretty
coarsely grained though.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,390
Can you think of more stages
a student might go through?

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,400
Maybe in between some of these steps or
before or after them.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,110
Try to expand the funnel until it
has at least ten total steps, and

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,840
put the steps that you've
thought of in this box.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,560
Since Audacity is a hypothetical
company, you can use Udacity or

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,580
another online education company
to generate ideas if you'd like.
