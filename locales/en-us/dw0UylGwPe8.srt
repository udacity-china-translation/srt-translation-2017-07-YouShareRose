00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,050
What changes when you have multiple
evaluation metrics instead of just one?

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,570
>> Well one thing that comes up when you
run evaluations of multiple metrics at

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,350
the same time,
is that the more things you test,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,370
the more likely you are to see
significant differences just by chance.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,656
So if you're testing 20 metrics, and
you have a 95% confidence level.

6
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:22,752
You would expect to see one case at
least that time where you got a result

7
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:27,400
that says it's significant but
it's only concurring by chance.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,130
So this is a problem, but you're not
sunk because it shouldn't be repeatable.

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,280
That is if you did the same experiment
on another day or you divide or

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,310
just slices or

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,610
you did some bootstrap analysis, you
wouldn't see the same metric showing up

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,860
as significant differences every time,
it should occur randomly.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,990
There's another technique for

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,450
this called multiple comparisons that
adjusts your significance level, so

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,990
that it accounts for how many metrics or
how many different tests you're doing.

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,534
>> All right when would I use that?

17
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:59,210
>> One thing a lot of people like to do
an experiment frameworks is do automatic

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,060
detection of differences.

19
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,760
So if you're doing exploratory data
analysis you can reanalyze your data and

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,620
make sure the same metric isn't
popping up every time and

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,640
see if the differences are repeatable.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,890
But if you want to set up say
automatic alerting that tells you,

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,120
one of my metrics was significantly
different on this experiment.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,520
You probably want to use multiple
comparisons and there's notes for

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,670
that in the instructor's notes.
