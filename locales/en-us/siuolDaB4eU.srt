1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,330
Now Carrie just spent a lot of
time talking about how can you use

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,610
external data?

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,260
But there's also a question about
how we can use our own data, or

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,710
basically do it ourselves.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,230
Right?

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,880
So there's sort of two
classes of methods.

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,500
Now one class of method basically
uses all of our existing data.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,840
If you're running experiments,
you probably have existing logs or

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,053
data capture that you're
using to measure metrics, and

10
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:24,360
sort of track your business.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,830
And so it's going to be a set of
techniques that are going to use

12
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,070
that set of existing data,

13
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,620
both retrospective analyses,
as well as running experiments.

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,460
We'll be going over those next.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,380
Now the other class of methods
are when you want to gather new data.

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,570
Now these are going to be methods
that you'll use when you want to

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,746
answer questions that you can't really
answer from your existing data.

18
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,660
The main techniques here
are going to be things like,

19
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,380
user experience research,
surveys, and focus groups.

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,130
And Caroline,

21
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,210
I think you're going to going over those
in more detail in the next video, right?

22
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,800
>> Yeah.

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,830
>> So let's talk a minute about what
you can do with your own external

24
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,680
logging data, or
data capture, from your site.

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,290
So first you can do what's
called retrospective, or

26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,560
observational analysis, where you look
at how a metric you're interested in, or

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,600
just measurements you take from your
site, change in response to changes

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,610
you've made in the past, experiments
you've run, big spikes in your business.

29
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,470
So that's good to get a baseline, and
it can also help you develop theories.

30
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,260
You can also use this data in
conjunction with other methods,

31
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,240
such as surveys or
user experience research,

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,890
to help you develop ideas of
what you want to look at.

33
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,060
So for example, if you had a bunch of
students in a lab doing a survey, or

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,230
a focus group, and you could see
that they were all getting stuck on

35
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,100
a particular quiz,
that might make you suspicious.

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,500
And you won't actually use your
logs to analyze, hey you know,

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,160
how does this quiz behave,
compared to other quizzes?

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,080
How long are people taking,
so on and so forth.

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,120
The problem with these studies is that
they're really, show you correlations,

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,300
not necessarily causation.

41
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,340
Because you're not running
a parallel A versus B, or

42
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,380
A versus B versus C versus D experiment.

43
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,480
It's really hard to establish
that the change you made

44
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,600
actually caused what happened, and
it's not some funny temporal effect.

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,910
So that's an important difference
between doing this type of experiment,

46
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,510
or doing this type of analysis, and
doing a real structured experiment.

47
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,350
>> As Carrie said, using retrospective
analysis is really best for

48
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,730
establishing a correlation and
not a causation.

49
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,840
So one method that we can
use to validate metrics

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
is actually running experiments.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,720
Now this may seem horribly circular.

52
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,350
We're going to run an experiment
to validate whether or

53
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,780
not we can use a metric for
evaluating experiments?

54
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,630
The thing is that,
what we want to do is we want to measure

55
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,080
that the metric is actually going
to move as we make changes.

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,350
So using Carrie's example, if we're
using the length of time it takes for

57
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,750
a student to complete a quiz as a metric
for whether or not that quiz is actually

58
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,900
going to be a good measure of students
understand that material, then

59
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,080
we have to actually test out and say,
okay, well I'm going to try this quiz,

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,780
and this other quiz, and I'm going to
try a completely different formulation.

61
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,280
And compare all of those
different quizzes and say,

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,410
okay, well, which ones of them
actually move my proposed metric?

63
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,890
Now we're going to talk about how we
use this method more when we talk about

64
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,540
sensitivity and robustness,
later on in this lesson.

65
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,330
>> Now, the other thing you shouldn't
forget is to talk to your colleagues,

66
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,190
because they have great ideas, or
may have worked in other companies that

67
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,800
use different metrics,
or worked in research.

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,050
And so you should talk to them about

69
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,390
what ideas they think make sense for
metrics.

70
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,160
And then, the other thing is, of course,

71
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,400
you want to think about
your company's culture.

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,630
Some companies don't want, necessarily,
the people developing the website

73
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,610
to think about how much
revenue they're bringing in,

74
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,620
they want to see innovative features.

75
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,890
And then other companies are very
focused on obtaining market share and

76
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,050
adding users, where as,
you know, another,

77
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,470
a different company might want to just
make their existing users happier.

78
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,350
So it's really important to take into
account your corporate culture as you

79
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,960
define your business metrics.

80
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,780
>> That makes sense.

81
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,620
Do you usually only use one
of these methods at a time?

82
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,430
>> You can, but

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,600
it's usually more robust to
triangulate between different methods.

84
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,450
So for example,
let's say that you wanted to see

85
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,618
if students are really
happy with your website.

86
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:09,090
So in our audacity experiment,
we want to say well,

87
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,060
are we,
are we seeing signs of happiness?

88
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,660
So first you might look through your
logs and say, given that somebody took

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,089
a second course, which we'll say
is being happy, what did they do?

90
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,860
How long did they spend?

91
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,380
How many months were
they active on the site?

92
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,350
You want to get some baseline for that.

93
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,630
And then given that they
took a second course,

94
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,180
then you might also want to trigger
surveys that happened within your site,

95
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,940
or do a focus group, where people
who've done a single course, actually

96
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,810
get a survey that says, you know, are
you considering taking a second course?

97
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,770
Were you happy with the first course?

98
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,730
And that can give you, maybe not a lot
of data, but some idea of whether they

99
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,830
were happy, and how that relates
to taking a second course.

100
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,870
So it's usually a good idea to try
to lay out the boundaries around

101
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,900
your metric.

102
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,170
You won't ever get exactly the same
results from a couple of different

103
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,380
techniques, but they can really give
you a good sense, in conjunction,

104
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,080
of what you might be missing, and
what the right things to measure are.
