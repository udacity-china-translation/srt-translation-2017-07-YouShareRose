00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,530
We've discussed the three main
considerations when you're

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,840
choosing a unit of diversion.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,720
Are there any other questions to keep in
mind when you're choosing a population?

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,840
>> Yeah, so first you want to
think about the fact that,

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,290
in anything but event diversion,
if you do cookie diversion,

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,080
if you do device diversion, you're
really looking at proxies for users.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,040
And that means you're going to have one
group of users on the A side of your

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,280
experiment and one group on the B side.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,890
Now if you do event based diversion,

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,150
you can end up with the mix of
the same people on both sides.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,030
So you have to be pretty careful in
this case to make sure you haven't

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,560
inadvertently mismatched your users.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,970
There are some other options.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,730
There's what's called
an intra-user experiment.

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,870
That typically means that you expose the
same user to this feature being on and

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,510
of over time, and

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,730
you actually analyze how they
behave in different time windows.

18
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,470
This has some pitfalls, for example,

19
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,850
you have to be really careful that
you choose a comparable time window.

20
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,270
You don't want to do this in
the two weeks before Christmas and

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,200
then have them behave very
differently in the second part.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,630
The other issues with a lot of features,
you have a frustration or a learning

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,430
problem, where people learn to use
the particular feature in the first two

24
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,740
weeks and then when you turn it off
they're like, why did my website change?

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,250
So you can get some different
behaviors as a result.

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,530
For certain other types of applications
like search ranking, preferences or,

27
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,090
you know, other things where you
actually have a ranked order list,

28
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,170
you have an option of running what's
called an interleaved experiment, where

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,840
you actually expose the same user to
the A and the B side at the same time.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,770
And typically this only works
in cases where you're looking at

31
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,950
reordering a list.

32
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,900
There's more information
in the instructor's notes

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,830
if you want to follow up on that.

34
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,380
But what we mainly talk
about in A/B testing

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,640
is what's called inter-user experiments.

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,630
That means you've got different people
on the A side and on the B side.

37
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,640
We'll talk in a minute about
a refinement of that called a cohort.

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,670
In a cohort, you try to match
up your entering class so

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,670
at least you have roughly the same
parameters in your two user groups.

40
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,290
In medical and drug treatment trials and
things like that,

41
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,750
they'll take this even a step further,
and they'll actually match up

42
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,830
patients in the trial based on
demographic information, age,

43
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,280
medical history, and
they'll actually do a paired analysis.

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,430
But because of what we don't know
about people on the internet, we're,

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,880
we don't even know if
these are real people.

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,440
You basically never see that
in internet experiments.
