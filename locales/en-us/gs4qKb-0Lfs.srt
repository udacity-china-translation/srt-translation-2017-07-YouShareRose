1
00:00:00,517 --> 00:00:01,089
Okay.

2
00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:04,021
We've looked at a lot of the
distributions you might see in your data

3
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:06,800
and used that information to choose
a specific summary metric or

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,897
to understand the sensitivity and
robustness of your summary metric.

5
00:00:09,897 --> 00:00:12,967
But now,
it's time to add a level of rigor.

6
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:15,657
In order to calculate a confidence
interval for your metric,

7
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:17,167
you're going to need two things.

8
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:20,107
You'll need to know the variance or
equivalently the standard

9
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:23,553
deviation of your metric and you'll
also need to know its distribution.

10
00:00:23,553 --> 00:00:26,126
In lesson one, we calculated
the confidence interval for

11
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,550
a probability metric, which we assumed
followed a binomial distribution.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,751
Then we calculated the standard error,

13
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:35,377
which was our estimate of the standard
deviation using the formula

14
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:38,177
the square root of p hat
times one minus p hat over n.

15
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:41,760
Then we calculated the width of
the confidence interval or the margin of

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,413
error, as the z score of our confidence
level times the standard error.

17
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:48,307
So we definitely needed to
know the standard error and

18
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:52,183
we also used the fact that this was
a binomial distribution in two ways.

19
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:55,328
First, we use the fact that this
was a binomial distribution to get

20
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:57,133
this formula for the standard error.

21
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,238
And second, this formula for the margin
of error depends on the assumption that

22
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:02,902
this is a normal distribution.

23
00:01:02,902 --> 00:01:06,697
And remember, the binomial approaches
a normal distribution as N gets larger.

24
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:10,846
So to summarize, if your type of metric
is a probability metric, you can usually

25
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:14,264
assume a binomial distribution,
which approximates a normal for

26
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:18,046
a large enough sample size and the
estimated variance will be the standard

27
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,813
deviation squared or
p hat times 1 minus p hat over N.

28
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:24,192
Now let's talk about some other
types of metrics you might see.

29
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:27,657
If your metric is a mean,
then by the central limit theorem, your

30
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:31,767
metric will follow a normal distribution
if the sample size is large enough.

31
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:35,549
And the variants of the metric will be
given by the variance of the sample,

32
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,965
which I'm representing as sigma
hat squared divided by the size of

33
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,643
the sample.

34
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:42,890
Notice the distinction between
the variance of the sample,

35
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,768
that is take each of your data points
and then collect the variance of them

36
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:49,949
versus the variance of the actual
metric, which means that

37
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:54,113
if you were to collect a new sample, how
would you expect this metric to vary?

38
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:57,000
We'll be going over an example
of this in a minute.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,843
Now this estimated variance
is an analytic result.

40
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:02,013
For other types of
summary metrics though,

41
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:04,893
estimating the variance
analytically may not be so easy.

42
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:08,233
Take the median, for example,
if the underlying data is normal and

43
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:11,640
the sample is large, then the median
will be approximately normal.

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,870
But if the underlying
data is not normal,

45
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,239
then the median might
not be normal either.

46
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,734
Suppose, for example, you're
considering latency and your latency is

47
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:23,510
a bimodal distribution since some people
have a slower internet connection and

48
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,047
some people have a faster type.

49
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:28,837
Then for a large enough sample,
the mean would be normally distributed.

50
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:32,672
Where this blue line is the distribution
of the underlined data and

51
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:35,353
the pink line is
the distribution of the mean.

52
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:38,386
The median on the other hand,
might not be normally distributed.

53
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:40,847
In this example,
you can see it looks pretty crazy.

54
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:45,023
Other percentiles besides the median
might also not be normally distributed.

55
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:46,984
To estimate the variance of the median,

56
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:50,973
you'd need to make an assumption about
how the underlying data was distributed.

57
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:52,901
And depending on your assumption,

58
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:56,187
it might not be easy to estimate
the variance analytically.

59
00:02:56,187 --> 00:03:00,330
So for a median or other percentile, the
distribution of the metric depends on

60
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,596
the distribution of the underlying
data and your estimate for

61
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:06,453
the variance will depend
on this assumption as well.

62
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,702
Another type of metric that's often
easier to analyze is a count or rather,

63
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:12,446
you're usually looking at
the difference between two counts,

64
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:14,663
say the experiment group
minus the control group.

65
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:18,278
This difference won't always
be normally distributed, but

66
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:21,830
it often is especially for
things like demographic data.

67
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,254
The estimated variance of the difference
is the sum of the variances

68
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:26,822
of the individual variables.

69
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:31,086
Other types of metrics, such as rates
have more unusual distributions,

70
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,368
but they can have analytic solutions.

71
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:35,873
Rates tend to follow
a poisson distribution and

72
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:39,705
the variance of the poisson distribution
is actually equal to the mean.

73
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:42,089
So you could estimate it by
taking the mean of your sample,

74
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,072
which I'll call x bar.

75
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:44,329
For your experiment though,

76
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,950
you would be interested in
the difference between two rates.

77
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,699
That is you would need to estimate
the variance of the difference between

78
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,245
two poisson distributions.

79
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:55,528
Or alternatively, you could test that
the ratio of the means is close to

80
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:57,290
one and compute the variance of that.

81
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,517
Unlike for the normally distributed
data, these difference in rates aren't

82
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:04,537
likely to be either poisson or
normal in distribution.

83
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,440
You can do this analytically and
there are several options.

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,557
See the Instructor's Notes.

85
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:13,022
But most people probably don't want
to and it can be a big investment and

86
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:14,080
hard to generalize.

87
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,237
We'll talk in a minute
about other options.

88
00:04:16,237 --> 00:04:19,310
Finally, businesses often
want to use general ratios.

89
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,463
For example, you might want to use the
ratio of click-through probabilities in

90
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,713
your experiment and
control group instead of the difference.

91
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:30,729
Like for the median, the distribution
and estimated variance of a ratio will

92
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,267
depend on the distribution for
the numerator and the denominator.

93
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:36,819
Often, you won't know those
distributions and for

94
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,081
anything more complicated
than two normals,

95
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:41,990
you often won't have an analytic
result for the variance.

96
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,481
You've already calculated
a confidence interval for

97
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:47,466
a probability in less than one
using the binomial distribution.

98
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:50,264
Now, I'd like you to calculate
a confidence interval for

99
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:52,732
a mean,
which will follow a normal distribution.

100
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:56,294
Suppose that audacity wants to measure
the mean number of students that visit

101
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:57,570
their home page each week.

102
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,602
So they record home page visits for
seven weeks and get seven measurements,

103
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:02,616
one for each week.

104
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:04,377
From this they can computer a mean,

105
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:08,145
which I'll represent as N bar by summing
the data points and dividing by 7.

106
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:10,912
Now what is the confidence interval for
this measurement?

107
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:14,891
To answer this, you'll need to calculate
the standard deviation of the seven

108
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:17,677
counts audacity collected,
which I'll call sigma.

109
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:18,400
You can do this any way you want.

110
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,804
One way would be to enter the numbers
into a Google spreadsheet or

111
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:25,285
you can copy the spreadsheet
linked in the Instructor's Notes.

112
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:28,203
To compute the standard deviation,
you would type equals and

113
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,064
use the standard deviation function.

114
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:33,956
Then you would select the appropriate
range, add a close paren and

115
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:34,799
press Enter.

116
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,737
Most programming languages also
have built in functions to compute

117
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,426
the standard deviation or
you could write your own function.

118
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:43,595
You'll also need to calculate
the standard error for the mean,

119
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:46,067
which is equal to the square
root of the variance.

120
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,482
That is sigma over
the square root of seven,

121
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,498
since seven is the number of
data points in our sample.

122
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:54,164
Use this to compute a 95%
confidence interval,

123
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:57,827
around audacity's measurement of
the mean number of users per week.

124
00:05:57,827 --> 00:06:01,233
Enter the upper and lower bounds of your
confidence interval in these boxes and

125
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,100
round each answer to
the nearest integer.
