1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,840
In the first case, both probabilities
would give the same result,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,120
regardless of whether the user
double clicked or single clicked.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,940
For example, suppose a user loads
the page, which generates a page view.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,080
Then one minute later,
they click twice, half a second apart.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,210
Assuming that the time interval is
longer than a minute, say five minutes,

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,690
then the cookie definition and the page
view definition of probabilities will

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,032
both count the single unique click and
give a result of one.

8
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:26,430
The click-through rate,
on the other hand,

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,480
would be two, since both clicks
would be counted separately,

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,570
which is a different answer than
if the user had single clicked.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,510
In the second case,

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,030
only the cookie definition would
give the same answer either way.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,340
Compare these two timelines.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,870
In the first timeline,
the user loads the page,

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,490
which generates a pageview,
then navigate away.

16
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,620
Then, one minute later,
they use the back button to return, and

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,600
it generates another pageview.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,680
And then they click a minute after that.

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,230
The second timeline is the same, but in
this case, the browser cached the page,

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,330
so the second pageview is missing.

21
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,050
Thus, by looking at your data,
all you can really see is that there was

22
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,800
a pageview, and then two minutes later,
there was a click.

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,050
The cookie probability will
calculate one unique click and

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,180
one user in both cases.

25
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,090
The pageview probability will also
calculate one unique click, but

26
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,095
in the first case there will be
two pageviews in the denominator.

27
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:18,240
And in the second, there will only
be one, giving a different result.

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,180
Finally, the rate will also calculate
a different number of pageviews in

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,580
the denominator, two versus one.

30
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,310
Giving a different answer.

31
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,850
In the last case, if two clicks
are recorded instead of one,

32
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,850
this is the same as double clicking.

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,690
So the rate will be affected,
and the probabilities will not.

34
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,350
However, suppose, instead,
that a click is completely missed.

35
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,850
So, instead of recording one pageview
with a click a minute later,

36
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,270
you just record a page
view with no click.

37
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,820
All three definitions will give one in
the case where there was a click, and

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,880
zero in the case where there was not.

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,000
So all the definitions will be affected.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,210
Perhaps it's not terribly surprising
that it's hard to choose a metric that

41
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,380
won't be affected by
a problem this drastic.
