1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,990
In the first case,
the number of signed in users is

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,700
definitely a good
population sizing metric.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,570
Since the unit of diversion is the
user-id, the signed in users are being

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,710
randomly assigned to the experiment and
control groups.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,590
So, you should definitely have roughly
the same number of users in each group.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,210
Now, number of cookies and number
of events are a little more tricky.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,785
They're not being directly randomized.

8
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:25,840
But, they should still be split
evenly between the two groups.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,330
Unless users in the experiment tend
to clear their cookies more often, or

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,598
visit fewer pages, or
something like that.

11
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,080
If that's happening,it's
probably not a good thing, and

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,150
it's definitely something
you want to know about.

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,072
So, these are also good
population sizing invariants.

14
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:43,240
The click-through rate on the Start Now
button is a good invariant metric.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,170
Since users click the Start Now
button before they see the course

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,000
list, the click-through rate on
the Start Now button shouldn't be

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,760
affected by this change.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,970
The time taken to complete a course,
on the other hand,

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,180
could be affected by this change.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,340
If ordering the courses differently
does cause users to enroll in different

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,070
courses, then that could change how long
it takes users to complete the courses

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,790
they do enroll in.

23
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,600
For example, maybe putting easier
courses first causes more users to start

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,420
with easier courses, and
then they finish them faster.

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,830
So, this would not be a good invariant.

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,100
In the second case, again,

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,310
the first three metrics will all be
good population sizing invariants.

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,500
Number of events is good since
this is the unit of diversion.

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,230
So, this is being randomly assigned
between the experiment and

30
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,610
control groups.

31
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,600
Signed in users and cookies are both
larger than the unit of diversion,

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,880
in the sense that one user or one cookie
could correspond to multiple events.

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,590
So, since the events are being randomly
assigned, the number of signed in users

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,390
and cookies shouldn't be different
between the two groups either.

35
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,950
The click-through rate of the Start Now
button would be a good invariant metric,

36
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,360
since users click Start Now
before viewing any videos.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,170
There could be a learning effect, but

38
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,470
you won't catch learning effects if
you're diverting by event anyway.

39
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,245
The time to get through a class
can't be tracked if you're using

40
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:56,720
event-based diversion.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,580
Since by the time the user gets
through a course, they could have been

42
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,170
assigned to both the experiment and
the control group multiple times.

43
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,980
Even if you could track this,
it wouldn't be a good invariant,

44
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,850
since load time could affect how
long it takes to complete a class.

45
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,790
For example, users could switch
tabs if videos load slowly, and

46
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,590
end up getting distracted, and
taking longer to complete the course.
