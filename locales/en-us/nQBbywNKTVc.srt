00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,850
Recall in lesson one, we used the
example of changing the Start Now button

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,880
on our online education website,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,700
Audacity, and we use click-through
probability as the metric.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,200
In this lesson, we'll be focusing
on metrics for experiments.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,770
We'll first cover how to define a
metric, which involves brainstorming and

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,660
establishing a suite of metrics.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,460
Then taking things from a high
level concept of a metric

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,420
to a practical definition that
works given your data capture.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,260
Then we'll explain how to build
intuition about your metrics and

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,250
understanding your metrics
sensitivity and robustness.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,190
We'll conclude with how to characterize
the variability of your metric.
