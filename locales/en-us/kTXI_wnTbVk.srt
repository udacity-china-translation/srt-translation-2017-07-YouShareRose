1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,660
To calculate the confidence interval,
I'll need the average of the seven

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,720
measurements, the standard deviation and
the standard error.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,550
I can compute the average using Google
spreadsheets average function, and

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,580
this comes out to about 91,000.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,290
Then I can compute the standard
deviation, using the same strategy but

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,610
with the standard deviation function.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,910
And this comes out to about 17,000.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,467
Finally the standard error for the
sample will be the standard deviation

9
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:31,736
divided by the square root of 7,
which comes to about 6,000.

10
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:34,816
Rounded to the nearest integer,

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:39,769
I get 91,762, 17,015 and 6,430.

12
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:43,136
Now, to calculate the confidence
interval, the estimated mean,

13
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:45,388
or n bar,
will be the center of the interval.

14
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:47,920
Then I'll need to calculate
the margin of error.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,746
Because this metric is
normally distributed,

16
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:54,488
the margin of error is the z score
times the standard error, and

17
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:59,007
since we're using a 95% confidence
interval, our Z score is 1.96,

18
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:02,278
then the margin of error
comes to about 12,605.

19
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:06,146
The upper bound of the confidence
interval will be the center plus

20
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:09,070
the margin of error, which is 104,367.

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,460
And the lower bound is 79,158.

22
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,690
So if Audacity repeated
the measurement for

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,660
another seven weeks,
they might expect to get anywhere

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,610
from 79,000 to a 104,000 as
the mean homepage visits per week
