1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,320
Okay, and assuming that we're
doing an inter-user experiment.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,910
That is, there are different
users in the different groups.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,650
Is there anything else we need
to decide about our population?

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,540
>> Well, you have to decide who
you're targeting in your users.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,290
So, for example, there's some easy
divisions of your user space.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,710
For example, what browser they're on
what geo location they come from,

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,020
what country,
what language they're using.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,620
And depending on your website
you may have more information.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,320
If they're logged in with a user ID,

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,620
you may know how long they've
been using your website.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,590
And then finally you may even have,
depending on what you're doing,

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,570
even demographic information, such as
their age, that you could use to target

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,270
a very specific population of,
of your user space.

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,070
>> Okay and would you typically
make that decision in advance?

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,870
>> Well there are a couple of reasons
why you might make that decision

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,400
in advance.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,011
So you may want to restrict
who sees your experiment for

18
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,613
a variety of different reasons.

19
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:55,432
So for example, if you're running
a feature and you're not sure if you're

20
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:58,295
going to release it and
it's a pretty high profile launch,

21
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:01,893
you might want to restrict how many
of your users have actually seen it.

22
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:05,120
So you don't get any, you know,
press coverage or blog coverage.

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,570
You might also not want to go through
the trouble of testing your feature if

24
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,980
you have a new UI.

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,590
If you want to release
it internationally,

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,980
you might have to go through much more
of a testing process with, you know,

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,260
is this language right?

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,260
Is this you know, the way we want to say
it in Japanese or something like that?

29
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,400
So you might want to
restrict by language.

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,260
Or even you might not be sure that your
feature works on old browsers, and

31
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,700
you might want to just restrict
it to say modern browsers.

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,910
So, there's a variety
of different reasons.

33
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,430
And the last one might be that,

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,270
if you're running a couple of different
experiments at your company at

35
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,020
the same time,
you might not want to overlap, right?

36
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,130
You might want to have, you know, oh,
I'm just going to take this section of

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,460
traffic, and you guys can run that other
experiment in Korean, and it'll be fine.

38
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,980
So, there's a bunch of reasons.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,845
And then the last reason is sort of
more numeric, which is you may not

40
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:55,275
want to dilute the effect of your
experiment across a global population.

41
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:58,865
So if you're analyzing an experiment for
the first time, and it only affects

42
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:02,975
English, you may want to actually do
your analysis specific on English, and

43
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:04,955
be able to ignore the rest
of the population.

44
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:05,955
>> That makes sense,

45
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:09,163
and would you ever not want to
target the experiment in advance?

46
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,785
>> Well,
sometimes you can't necessarily ID

47
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:13,975
who a particular feature
is going to affect.

48
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:17,540
Like if you look for
all search queries that bring up images.

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,410
You may not really know exactly
which space that's going to be.

50
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,590
You may also be in a situation
where you want to test the effect

51
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,500
across your global population, because
you're not sure if it really works.

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,550
You know, you may not be sure your
targeting is exact, the way you want.

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,320
And then finally you may just
not care that much because it

54
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,400
could be a feature that
effects 90% of your traffic.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,590
And it's just not worth the trouble
to try to target the experiment.

56
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,020
>> So what's involved in this?

57
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,570
Is this the same as in lesson three,

58
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,905
just compute my metrics on
the segments I care about?

59
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:49,958
>> Well, you probably want to talk
to your engineering team first, or

60
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,575
whoever implemented the feature.

61
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:55,276
So that you can really tell are we sure
that this is not going to trigger for

62
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,510
this particular browser.

63
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,270
It's, you know,
is our targeting exactly right?

64
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,330
And are we actually concerned
about potential interactions so

65
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,660
we might want to run
a global experiment.

66
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,600
The second thing is, you know, you
always want to make sure that you have

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,860
the same filters on the targeted and
untargeted parts of your experiment.

68
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,890
So you don't want to do
accidentally include

69
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,660
only logged-in users
on the targeted bit.

70
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,670
And then when you go to compare it to
your global population you realize that

71
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,300
there's something completely wrong.

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,720
So you want to make sure
that everything's lined up.

73
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,880
And finally,
before you launch a big change,

74
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,700
you may actually want to go back and run
a global experiment and make sure that

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,550
you don't have any unintentional effects
on the traffic you weren't targeting.

76
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,740
because that can be a real issue.
