00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,550
The first step to sanity checking
our results is choosing a set of

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,180
invariant metrics.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,939
Like Diane mentioned, there are two
types of invariant metrics.

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:12,640
Population sizing metrics, and any other
metrics you don't expect to change.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,810
Now, I'm going to describe
two experiments and

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,690
for each one, I want you to think about
what metrics should be invariant.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,420
That is, what would be the same in
the control and experiment group?

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,490
In the first experiment,

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,240
Audacity changes the order of
courses in the course list

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,000
to see how much this affects which
courses users eventually enroll in.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,080
The unit of diversion is a user ID
since users may visit the site multiple

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,570
times to explore classes before
finally enrolling in one.

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,730
In the second experiment, Audacity
changes the infrastructure serving

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,530
videos hoping to reduce
the video load time.

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,020
This time,
the unit of diversion is an event.

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,170
Now, which of the following
metrics would be good invariants?

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,882
Number of signed in users,
number of cookies, number of events,

18
00:00:52,882 --> 00:00:56,710
click-through rate or
CTR on the Start Now button.

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,188
Remember, this button takes the user
from the homepage to the course list.

20
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:04,660
Or finally, the time it takes a student
to complete a course on average.

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,280
Check each box if that metric would be
a good invariant for that experiment.
