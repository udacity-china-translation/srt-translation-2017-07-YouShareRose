1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,520
Our recent online example is from
Facebook and some Cornell researchers,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,670
who studied how emotions can
be spread on social media.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,640
Specifically, one set of randomly
selected participants saw a newsfeed

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,020
with slightly fewer negative posts and

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,825
another set saw a newsfeed with
slightly fewer positive posts.

6
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:21,765
A week later, the researchers measured
whether the posts from the participants

7
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,365
were more negative or positive.

8
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:28,625
For the Facebook experiment, the risk to
the participants is substantially lower

9
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,925
than either of the other experiments,
and there is no discussion

10
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:34,575
about the potential benefits that
might result from such a study.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,040
Now, these are three examples of
problematic, or potentially problematic,

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,390
experiments.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,670
Clearly, these are the exceptions to
the rule, rather than the common case.

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,720
But it is because of these
problematic experiments that IRBs, or

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,790
institutional review boards, came to be.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,345
IRBs review possible experiments and

17
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:58,380
ensure that participants
are adequately protected.

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,800
That said, most IRBs are tied to
academic institutions and it's still

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,918
a grey area about whether Internet
studies should be reviewed by an IRB.

20
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:10,928
However, online say you should
still make protecting participants

21
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:12,640
a primary concern.

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,350
The four main principles
to consider are, one, risk.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,080
What risk is the participant
being exposed to?

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,470
Two, benefit.

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,500
What benefits might be
the outcome of the study?

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,020
Three, choice.

27
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,600
What other choices do participants have?

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,100
And finally, four, privacy.

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,790
What expectation of privacy and
confidentiality do participants have?

30
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,060
We'll discuss each of these next.
