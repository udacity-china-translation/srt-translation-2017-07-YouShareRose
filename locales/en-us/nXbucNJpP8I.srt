1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,250
Lets say we have a biased coin and

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,350
it has a probability three-quarters of
coming up heads, which I'll call p.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,660
This coin could actually
be a visitor to a webpage,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,225
who has a three-quarters probability
of clicking a button, but

5
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:14,840
I'm going to do this example
with coins for simplicity.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,610
We we'll define success to be heads and
failure to be tails.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,790
This doesn't necessarily mean
we're upset if we get a tails,

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,900
it's just the way of specifying
what the two outcomes are.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,600
Now, let's say we flip
the coin ten times.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,480
How many times will it come up heads?

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,060
Of course, it could come up
heads zero times, ten times, or

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,320
anything in between, but some outcomes
will be more likely than others.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,260
If we mark the probability
of each number of heads,

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,450
we'll get something
that looks like this.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,820
As you can see, the most likely
results are seven or eight heads, but

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,850
anything between six and
nine is reasonably likely.

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,960
Like Carrie mentioned, this distribution
is called a binomial distribution, and

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,300
we can draw it for any number of flips.

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,700
To make it easier to do this,
I'll relabel this axis

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,420
as the percentage of flips that
came up heads, or the fraction.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,920
As you increase n, the binomial
distribution starts to look more and

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,720
more like a normal distribution.

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,400
Here, you see the binomial
distribution with n equals 30,

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,770
and the normal distribution
overlaid in blue.

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,630
The binomial and the normal
distribution that approximate it

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,970
will have the same mean,
which will be equal to p,

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,850
the probability that
the coin comes up heads.

28
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,590
And the standard deviation will be the
square root of p times 1 minus p over N,

29
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,710
where N is the total number of flips.

30
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,560
Now in this case,

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,400
we assumed that we knew the probability
that the coin would come up heads.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,970
Let's instead consider a case
where we don't know that.

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,010
We flip the coin 20 times,
so N equals 20,

34
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,300
and it comes up heads 16 times,
which I'll call X.

35
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,830
Now, let's say we want to estimate the
probability the coin will come up heads.

36
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,110
That is,
we want to guess the bias of the coin.

37
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,750
Of course, this could be a fair coin
that happens to come up heads more than

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,390
tails, but the results we saw will be
more likely if the coin is biased.

39
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,870
To estimate the bias,
which I'll call p hat,

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,040
it's an estimate of the probability.

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,700
We'll take the number of heads,
in this case 16,

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,830
and divide by the number of flips,
in this case, 20.

43
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,120
And we get four-fifths.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,460
So, our best estimate is that this
coin has a probability four-fifths

45
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,000
of coming up heads.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,930
If you'd like to see more details
on what the binomial distribution

47
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,440
looks like for

48
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,390
different parameters, the page linked in
the instructor's notes may be helpful.

49
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,511
In order to use
the binomial distribution,

50
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:30,068
a few assumptions have to hold.

51
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:32,933
First, there have to be
exactly two types of outcomes.

52
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,520
We've been calling these success and
failure.

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,805
And second,
the events have to be independent.

54
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:41,851
Learning the outcome of one coin flip
doesn't tell you anything about whether

55
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:44,080
the next coin came up heads.

56
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,560
And finally, the events need to
follow an identical distribution.

57
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,250
That is, the probability of success
needs to be the same for all of them.

58
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,960
In practice,

59
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,790
identifying cases where your events
are independent can be kind of tricky.

60
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,940
So let's go over some examples.

61
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,470
First, suppose you shuffle a deck
of 52 cards and you draw and

62
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,420
hold the first 20 cards.

63
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,270
Each card is an event and the outcome
is whether the card is red or black.

64
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,090
Next, suppose you roll a die 50 times.

65
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,840
Each roll is an event and

66
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,400
you choose to label six as a success and
any other result as a failure.

67
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,970
Next, suppose a search engine,
such as Google,

68
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,080
is measuring how often people click on
search results after making a search.

69
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,800
Each event is one search made
on the search engine and

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,470
the outcome is whether the person
clicked any link in the results.

71
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,585
Next, supposed an online education
company, like Udacity, is measuring how

72
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:38,282
many of the students who enroll in
a course complete it within two months.

73
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:39,716
Each event is one student and

74
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:43,678
the outcome is whether the student has
completed the course two months later.

75
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:47,204
Finally, suppose an online
shopping company, such as Amazon,

76
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:51,242
is measuring how often items that are
added to a shopping cart are purchased

77
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:52,570
within a week.

78
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,580
Each event is a single item and

79
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,600
the outcome is whether the item
has been purchased a week later.

80
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,540
For each of these situations,

81
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,760
check the box if you think it is valid
to assume a binomial distribution, and

82
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,320
specifically, think about whether
the events will be independent.

83
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,430
Some of them are a bit subjective,
but take your best guess.
