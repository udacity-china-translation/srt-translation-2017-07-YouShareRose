1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,670
Okay.
So we've talked about how to choose and

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,650
characterize metrics to evaluate for
your test.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,580
And presumably you know what change or
changes you want to test.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,570
Now it's time to really apply what
you've learned in working through

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,050
the decisions you need to make in
actually designing your experiment.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,060
First, we'll need to decide how you
define what you use as a subject in your

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,970
experiment and in your control.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,340
In other words, what are the units in
the population that you're going to be

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,660
running the test on and comparing?

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,090
We call this the unit of diversion.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,619
Next, we'll need to
choose the population.

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,430
You'll need to decide which
subjects are eligible.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,240
Everyone?

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Only subjects in the U.S.?

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,910
When you're testing how to change and
computing the evaluation metrics,

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,080
you need to ensure that
you're doing the test and

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,970
computing the metric on
equivalent populations.

18
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,540
Then we'll use those decisions and what
we learned in lesson three to properly

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,550
size your experiment, before concluding
with a few other decisions you need to

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,720
finalize your experiment design,
such as the duration of the experiment.
