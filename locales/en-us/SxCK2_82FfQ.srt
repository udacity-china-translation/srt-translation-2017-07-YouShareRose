1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,570
We defined the estimated difference
as the experimental probability

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,460
minus the control probability.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,110
And that comes to 0.0289.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,222
The margin of error is equal to
the pulled standard error times 1.96,

5
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,357
which is our Z score for
our confidence level of 95%.

6
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:19,202
And that comes to 0.0087.

7
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:23,823
The lower bound of the confidence
interval will be d hat minus m,

8
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,057
which comes to 0.0202.

9
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:30,683
And the upper bound will d hat plus m,
which comes to 0.0376.

10
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:33,714
So what can we conclude
from these results?

11
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:38,272
Well, we can conclude it is highly
probable that click-through probability

12
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,797
changed by at least 2%.

13
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:43,623
Remember that we want to look for both
statistical and practical significance,

14
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:45,170
and here we have both.

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,400
Because 2% was our practical
significance level, and we

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,040
can be confident that we have at least
that big of a change at the 95% level.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,640
Based on this, I would definitely
launch the new version.
