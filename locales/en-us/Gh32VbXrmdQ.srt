1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,560
Diane, can you tell me more about how to
choose the subject of your experiment?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,050
First, what does that mean?

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,550
>> So, what you need to do is you
need to decide how to assign events

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,140
to either the control or
to the experiment.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,540
Now what you could do is you could
randomly assign every event.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,390
So for example,
every page view to either the control or

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,660
the experiment, but
then if you have a user visible change,

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,760
the user's basically going to be like,
oh, I see the change.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,280
They reload.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,560
I don't see the change.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,150
What's kind of going on?

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,030
So typically what you want to do for
a user visible change

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,610
is that you want to basically
assign people as opposed to events.

14
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,380
Now the problem with online testing is,
what's a person?

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,447
Like, how do you actually
determine who a person is?

16
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:42,495
One obvious example is to use
a user ID like a log in, but

17
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:47,260
the problem there is,
each person could have multiple log ins.

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,000
You know, for example, I have both
a consumer and a corporate account.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,200
Right?
And so, you know, if you're a student,

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,410
you could have multiple
different accounts,

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,430
if you wanted to try the quiz in
different ways or for whatever reason.

22
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,140
So each person doesn't have
to have a single account.

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,129
Now another option is to basically use
an anonymous identifier like a cookie.

24
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,640
This is basically something that gets

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,530
assigned to a particular
browser in a device.

26
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,850
Now, again the same issue happens here,
right?

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,310
Because this is tied to a single
browser and single device if you change

28
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,580
from your laptop to your mobile phone,
if you change from Safari to Chrome,

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,190
in each of those cases,
you're going to be changing the cookie.

30
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,450
And, so in any case, if you're
trying to basically assign a person,

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,210
you're going to be using
some imperfect proxy.

32
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,140
Now in each of these cases, whether
you're doing an event based diversion,

33
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,770
a cookie based, or a user ID, these are
all what we call our unit of diversion.

34
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,430
So I think before we sort of discuss the
pros and cons of these, I think you're

35
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,340
going to be going through the details
of what each of these really mean.

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,840
>> Yeah.
