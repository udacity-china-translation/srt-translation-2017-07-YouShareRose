1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,200
Now that we've set up a hypothesis test,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,620
how will we decide whether
to reject the null?

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,440
>> Well, we're going to need to look at
our conference intervals in a slightly

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,500
different way.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,610
So remember in this case,
we actually have two samples.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,910
We have the control side,

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,100
which may have a different number
of users from the experiment side.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,030
So we'll need to compare the proportion
of clicks estimated on the control side,

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,130
with the proportion estimated
on the experiment side.

10
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,730
Then the quantitative task tells us
whether it's likely that the results we

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,440
got, the difference we observed, could
have occurred by chance, or if it would

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,920
be extremely unlikely to have occurred
if the two sides were actually the same.
