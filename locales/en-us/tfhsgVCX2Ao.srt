1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,950
Now that you know how to calculate
the number of page views you'll need for

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,940
an experiment,

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,280
I want you to consider the following
possible changes to your experiment.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,150
And decide whether each will increase or

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,860
decrease the number of
page views you need.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,602
First, suppose
the click-through-probability in your

7
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:17,299
control group had been higher but
still less than 50%.

8
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:21,805
Would you need more page views or
fewer to get the same sensitivity?

9
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:25,435
Second, suppose you decided to increase
your practical significance level,

10
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,255
which we've been calling dmin.

11
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:31,815
That is, you would no longer care about
a 2% change but you would, for example,

12
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:35,300
want to see a 3% change in
order to launch the experiment.

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,340
Third, suppose we decided to
increase your confidence level

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,610
which is also called 1 minus alpha.

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,050
For example,
maybe instead of 95% confidence,

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,020
you would choose a 99% confidence level.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,870
Finally, suppose you wanted
to get a higher sensitivity

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,590
which is also called 1 minus beta at
the practical significance boundary.

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,720
For each case, mark whether you
think you would need to increase or

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,430
decrease the number of page views
to keep everything else the same.

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,010
I encourage you to think about what
you would expect to happen, then

22
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,640
try changing the numbers in the online
calculator to see what actually happens.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,240
If you can't figure out why
a change has the effect it does,

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,250

an explanation.
