1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,690
Let's expand on this list of steps
that makes up our current funnel.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,660
First, we could break up
the step exploring the site.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,810
Exploring the site could mean that
the student viewed a page listing

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,840
all the classes that Audacity offers.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,510
Or, it could mean that, from that list,

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,050
the student clicked on an individual
course to view more details about it.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,240
Next, there are a lot of steps
between creating an account and

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,570
completing a class.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,660
First you could look at how many
students start taking a class or

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,120
enroll in that class.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,870
And since classes have several lessons,

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,440
you could keep track of
progress through the class.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,130
How many users finish lesson one,
lesson two, et cetera.

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,190
Audacity also provides coaching, so

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,750
during the lessons students can ask for
help.

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,290
This is a paid service, so

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,590
this is also how the business
becomes financially sustainable.

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,520
There are different levels of coaching
based on how much help the student

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,550
needs, so you could also track
how many students use each level.

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,390
After a student completes a course,

21
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,100
you could go on to track whether that
student enrolls in a second course.

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,240
And ultimately you want to know how
many students get jobs with the help of

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,320
Audacity classes,
although this could be hard to measure.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,235
Once we've made a list
of potential steps,

25
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:07,950
we can pick the most important ones,
and use them to define a funnel.

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,289
In this case I've chosen the number
of visits to the homepage,

27
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:15,511
the number of visits to the course list,
the number of visits to each individual

28
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:18,047
course page,
the number of accounts created.

29
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:20,164
The number of enrollments and courses,

30
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,405
the number of students
who used coaching,

31
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:26,390
the number of students who complete
a course, and the number of students who

32
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,390
go on to get a job as the steps that
will make up our primary funnel.

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,160
The reason this is called a funnel
is that typically you have fewer and

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,920
fewer users that get to
each stage of the funnel.

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,430
If you look at the actual timeline for
a particular user,

36
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,750
though, it's more like a swirl.

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,620
For example,

38
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,450
in this funnel, users might complete
courses without accessing coaching.

39
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,930
And students who haven't
completed a course yet,

40
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,170
might return to enroll in a new course.

41
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,240
It's also important to consider how
this funnel would look across different

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,360
platforms.

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,310
Sometimes iPhone and Android apps
have a slightly different flow

44
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,160
both from each other and
from your desktop site.

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,350
Although, in this case, these stages
should be supported on all platforms.

46
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,419
You also need to be able to track
progress through the funnel across

47
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,410
platforms.

48
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,770
For example, you might see that people
start the class on their phone,

49
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,880
then continue it on their laptop.

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,810
Each stage in the funnel right now
is a metric that you could use for

51
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,680
an experiment, the number of users
who reach that point in the funnel.

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,910
This type of metric is called a count.

53
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,770
However, sometimes instead of a count,
you'll want to use a rate or

54
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,170
a probability like you
saw in lesson one.

55
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,820
Often, you'll want to keep the counts
at a few key points in the funnel.

56
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,850
For example, the number of people
who visit the homepage and

57
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,300
the number of people
who enroll in courses.

58
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,990
For other points in the funnel,

59
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,500
you might want to switch to
a rate by dividing the number of

60
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,070
users at that level of the funnel by
the number at the previous level.

61
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,960
For example,
instead of measuring the number of users

62
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,730
who visit the course list, you might
measure the rate at which people

63
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,100
progress from viewing the overview
page to the list of courses.

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,730
Since people move between these
two levels of the funnel using

65
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,540
the Start Now button,
this is the same as the click-through

66
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,550
rate of the Start Now button
that we discussed in lesson one.

67
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,440
The reason to use a rate is because you
want to first figure out how many people

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
enter the funnel.

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,010
And then increase the rate at which
people progress down the funnel.

70
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,550
For each rate in the funnel, you might
also care about the probability that

71
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,490
a unique user progresses
down the funnel.

72
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,750
For viewing the list of courses,
you probably care about how

73
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,890
easy it is to do this from the Course
Overview page, which is all right.

74
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,570
But you probably also care
about whether a student reached

75
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,100
the course list at all,
which is a binary probability.

76
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,960
Now for all of these metrics, they're
not yet metrics you could actually use.

77
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,010
We start with these high level concepts.

78
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,790
What business objective you're
tracking through the funnel,

79
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,100
whether you care about the absolute
number or the count, the usability, or

80
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,160
the rate, or the progression,
the probability.

81
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,450
But, we still have to transform
these into full definitions.

82
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,430
Before we tackle that though,
we're first going to go into some

83
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,420
other techniques for coming up with
these high level concept metrics.
