00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,975
Like Diane mentioned, if you don't
want to run a lot of AA experiments,

2
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:07,728
you can run one experiment and then use
it to estimate the variability of your

3
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:10,445
metric using something
called the Bootstrap Method.

4
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:13,908
The idea in bootstrapping is
that you run one experiment.

5
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:17,502
And even though in our spreadsheet we
only showed one number from each group,

6
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:20,214
for each experiment,
the click-through probability,

7
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:23,866
those numbers were actually calculated
from a lot of individual data points,

8
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:27,240
about a bunch of individual
page views and clicks.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,070
Then you take a random sample
of those data points from each

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,980
side of the experiment, and
calculate the click-through

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,290
probability based on that random sample
as if it were a full experimental group.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,810
Then you record the difference in
click through probabilities and

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,260
use that as a simulated experiment.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,370
Then you repeat this process over and
over, recording the results.

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,910
And you can use the results as if
you had run multiple experiments,

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,920
even though you really only
ran one big experiment.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,620
So the numbers in this spreadsheet,

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,660
we've been assuming that they
came from multiple A/A tests.

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,847
But they actually could have
come from one big experiment,

20
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:03,213
from which we drew
many bootstrap samples.

21
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:06,528
Now it's your turn to calculate
confidence intervals empirically.

22
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:10,000
Follow the link in the instructor's
notes to get to this spreadsheet with

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,730
values of click through
probability across 40 experiments.

24
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,190
These could be 40 different A/A tests,
or

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,070
they could be 40 groups
sampled using bootstrapping.

26
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,920
The analysis is the same.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,980
Note that the sample size was 100
users in each group of the experiment.

28
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,310
For each experiment,

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,736
calculate the difference in
the click-through-probability between

30
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:30,430
the two groups.

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,002
Then calculate a 95% confidence
interval in two different ways.

32
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:37,406
First, calculate the standard
deviation of the differences, and

33
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:41,287
then assume that the metric is normally
distributed to calculate the width of

34
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,675
the confidence interval.

35
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:45,865
Use the average of the 40 differences
as the point estimate, or

36
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:47,898
the center of your confidence interval.

37
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:51,948
Second, calculate an empirical
confidence interval Using just

38
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:53,127
the differences,

39
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:57,188
not making any assumption about
the distribution of the metric.

40
00:01:57,188 --> 00:01:58,805
You can use Google Spreadsheets or

41
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:01,488
any other method you want to
carry out the calculations.

42
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,986
Write the upper and lower bounds of your
two confidence levels in these boxes to

43
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,000
four decimal places.
