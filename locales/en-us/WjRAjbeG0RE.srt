1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,880
The search engine case
is a minimal risk.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,710
The search engine is simply providing
additional information that was

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,390
already publicly available.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,620
The health app case is potentially
more than minimal risk.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,930
This is providing medical
advice tailored to individuals.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,020
So if the advice is incorrect, it could
cause users significant health risks.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,200
Also, depending on the exact
information given,

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,140
the app may be subject to
additional FDA regulation.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,690
The encyclopedia case is minimal risk.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,260
Changing the location of a search
bar is a pretty harmless change.
