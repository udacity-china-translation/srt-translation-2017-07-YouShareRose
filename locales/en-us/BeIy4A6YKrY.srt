1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,620
Now that we know the general
change we want to make,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,180
we need to choose a metric
to measure that change.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,320
For the current version of our
hypothesis, we didn't really talk about

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,510
how to measure whether changing
the color scheme was an improvement.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,100
What Audacity ultimately cares about
is how many people actually complete

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,798
courses, so one possible metric is
total number of courses completed.

7
00:00:19,798 --> 00:00:23,980
However, given that it can take students
weeks or months to finish courses,

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,940
using this metric would simply take
too much time to be practical.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,210
An alternative is how many users
actually click on the Start Now button.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,530
The assumption is that if more
people click the button and

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,930
thus move on to exploring the site,
then eventually,

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,310
some of them will create an account and
go on to complete a course.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,530
In other words, increasing the rate at
which users progress down the funnel at

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,850
one level will have a positive impact
on the end of the funnel as well.

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,580
Can you think of any problems
with counting clicks?

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,800
What happens if more total users
view the page in one version of

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,070
the experiment?

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,040
Suppose these dots are the total
number of visitors in each group of

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,320
the experiment, and the yellow
dots are the ones who clicked.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,630
More total clicks occurred
in this version, but

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,390
there was a greater percentage
of clicks in this version.

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,520
So instead, we could use the fraction
of page visitors who click.

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,210
That is the number of clicks
on the view course's button

24
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,090
divided by the number of
page views to the home page.

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,120
This metric is commonly called
click-through rate, or CTR.

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,719
There's also a closely related metric
which many people also refer to as

27
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:29,795
click-through rate, but
I'll call it click-through probability.

28
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:33,810
Click-through probability is defined as
the number of unique visitors who click

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,310
at least once divided by the number
of unique visitors who view the page.

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,040
To see how these two
metrics are different,

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,820
suppose you have a webpage and
two users visit the homepage.

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,320
The first leaves without
clicking the Start Now button,

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,030
which means they clicked 0 times.

34
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,840
And the second person clicks 5 times.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,430
Maybe the next page loaded slowly, so
the user impatiently clicked 5 times.

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,780
In this case,
the click-through rate equals 2.5,

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,643
since there were 5 total clicks and
2 total page views.

38
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:06,729
But the click-through
probability equals 0.5,

39
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,900
since half the users who
visited the page clicked.

40
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,390
Rates and probabilities have
different characteristics,

41
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,800
which we'll talk about
further in lesson three.

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,770
For the purpose of this lesson,
we're going to use click click-through

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,920
probability as our metric,
and not click-through rate.

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,790
Given this, our updated hypothesis

45
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,710
is that we will increase the
click-through probability of the button.

46
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,270
And we assume that that will ultimately
increase the final business metric,

47
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,660
which is total courses completed
