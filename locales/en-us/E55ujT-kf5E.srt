1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,990
Knowing which questions to consider to
evaluate the ethics of a proposed test

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,830
is definitely important.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,345
As is a data policy so

4
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:11,300
test-runners will know how they
can use the data they collect.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,860
We hope you agree that
the history of A/B testing and

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,850
of IRBs are interesting, but
they're not ethically necessary.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,600
Knowing what principles to
uphold when running A/B tests is

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,520
also an important thing to know.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,770
In fact, it would be hard to cover
the first point well without

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,530
teaching this too.
