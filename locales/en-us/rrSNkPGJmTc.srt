00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,150
Congratulations on
completing the lesson.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,070
You learned about the history of A/B
testing beyond the use in technology,

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,330
and when A/B testing is and
is not useful.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,090
We then introduced the business example
we'll be using throughout the course and

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,530
used a simple scenario to set
up an A/B test end to end.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,440
In this proposed experiment,
you learned how to state and

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,920
evaluate a testable hypothesis.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,190
This involves choosing a metric for
evaluating the change and

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,740
establishing what change in that metric
would be practically significant.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,910
We discussed the difference
between practical and

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,230
statistical significance and how to
compute a binomial conflict interval.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,960
You put all of that together to be
able to compute the statistical

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,360
power of an experiment and understand
the tradeoffs between power and size.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,080
Finally, you apply those
concepts to analyzing the results

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,970
of an experiment and understanding
what you can and cannot conclude.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,290
In the next lesson,
we'll go over what you need to keep

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,080
in mind to protect participants
in your experiments.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,590
See you then.
