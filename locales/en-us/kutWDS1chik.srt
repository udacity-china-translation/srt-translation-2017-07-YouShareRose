1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,900
In the first case, Audacity
definitely has access to this data.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,230
But students could take a long time
between completing one course and

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,670
signing up for another.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,080
So this metric probably takes too long
to measure during most A/B tests.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,690
In the other two cases,

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,110
the companies don't have direct
access to the data they want.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,430
The shopping company doesn't know
how happy its users are, and

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,140
the search engine doesn't know whether
users found the information they wanted.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,650
So these two ideal metrics can't
be directly calculated at all.

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,046
So the answer is that all of these
metrics would be difficult to

11
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:35,980
use in an experiment.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,750
Lets talk to Diane and Carrie about
some other techniques you can

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,920
use in the type of situation to
get a proxy for what you want.
