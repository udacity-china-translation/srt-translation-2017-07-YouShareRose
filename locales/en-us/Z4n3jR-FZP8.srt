00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,890
For the next few videos, we're going
to go over some more examples of when

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,280
you can and can't use A/B tests.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,950
As well as some other techniques you
can use instead of A/B testing, and

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,020
a brief history of A/B testing.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,610
After that, I'll introduce the example
A/B test that we'll be using for

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,010
the rest of this lesson.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,470
So if you'd rather skip to this point,
you can do so

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,980
by following the link in
the Instructor's Notes.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,420
Right now, I'm going to go over a list
of possible changes you might consider

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,170
using A/B testing for, and

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,760
ask you to decide when A/B
testing would be appropriate.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,080
First, suppose an online
shopping company,

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,070
like Amazon, wants to know whether
their site is complete, or

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,530
whether there are products users
want to buy, that they don't have.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,710
Check this box if you think they could
answer this question using an A/B test.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,640
Second, suppose the company
already has a free service.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,640
Maybe they have a to-do list app and

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,400
they want to provide a premium service
that offers additional functionality.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,210
To access the premium service,
users would need to upgrade,

20
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,150
create a log in, and
explore the new functionality.

21
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,230
Check this box if you think the company
should test out this change,

22
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,790
using A/B testing.

23
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,995
Third, consider a site that provides
a list of Movie recommendations for

24
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:09,085
users, such as Netflix.

25
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:13,035
They create a new algorithm to
rank the possible recommendations.

26
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:15,445
Could this be tested using AB testing?

27
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:19,275
Finally, suppose you wanted to change
your backend infrastructure, which could

28
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:23,455
impact how quickly the page loads, what
results users see, and other things.

29
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:25,995
Would an A/B test be appropriate
to test this change?
