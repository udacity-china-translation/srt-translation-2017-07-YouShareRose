1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:03,907
For online A/B testing then,
the questions come down to, 1,

2
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:07,439
are users informed about
the data gathering in some form,

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,776
such as via a terms and
services, or a privacy policy?

4
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:14,938
2, what user identifiers are tied
to the data being gathered?

5
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:19,530
Especially if there is personally
identifiable information, such as name,

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,547
email, phone number, address,

7
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:26,154
then the data collected becomes much
more sensitive, and subject to review.

8
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:29,650
3, what type of data is being collected?

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,900
How sensitive is it?

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,830
Is there health or
financial data being collected?

11
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:39,320
4, what level of confidentiality and
security is the data subject to?

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,170
Can anyone at the company access
the data, especially if it is personally

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,410
identifiable, or is the data secured
with accesses logged and audited?

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,500
It is worth noting that these concerns
should apply to online services, period,

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,655
regardless of whether AB
testing is happening or not.

16
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:59,804
Now, one additional question
that often gets asked is,

17
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:02,300
what about informed consent?

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,170
Informed consent is a process
by which participants

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,860
are told that the risks that they may
face if they participate in the study.

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,130
What benefits might result.

21
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,700
What other options they have.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,710
What data is being gathered, and
how that data is being handled.

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,760
Typically, informed consent is
a process by which participants

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,610
are given a document that
has all of that information.

25
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,450
And then, participants can
choose whether to participate in

26
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,980
the study, or not.

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,910
When IRB's are assessing a study,

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,160
they also get to decide whether
an informed consent is required, or not.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,350
While many people may think that
informed consent is required

30
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,890
whenever a study is considered
human subject research.

31
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,550
In fact, situations where informed
consent may not be required

32
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,960
are when the risk is minimal, and the
data being gathered is not identified.
