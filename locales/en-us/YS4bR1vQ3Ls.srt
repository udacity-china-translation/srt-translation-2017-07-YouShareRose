1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,070
In this lesson, we first learned about
what the different possible choices for

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,360
a unit of diversion is and
why we might have a preference.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,020
We also discussed how
to choose a population.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,640
We then walked through the irrative
process of sizing your experiment, and

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,420
how to choose how long your
experiment will run for.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,130
When you put these decisions together
with what we discussed in lesson one

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,190
about statistical power and
practical significance,

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,130
you have gone through all the decisions
necessary to design your experiment.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,610
In the next lesson, we'll be finishing
up our course by going through how to

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,250
evaluate the results from our AB test.
