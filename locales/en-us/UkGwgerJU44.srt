1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,420
Suppose your company is considering
collecting or storing the following data

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,510
either to use in an A/B test or
for some other purpose.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,550
In which cases would the data
be considered sensitive?

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,760
In other words,

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,040
people would be at risk if the data
were exposed to non-trusted individuals.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,140
First, suppose you are considering
analyzing existing census data.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,820
Containing race, age and gender
distributions broken down by zip code.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,020
Is this census data sensitive?

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,640
Next suppose you're interested in how
many users visit some specific websites.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,640
So you use a source like comScore or

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,680
HitWise to gather a count of the number
of users visiting those sites each day.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,770
ComScore and Hitwise are products
providing this kind of online analytics.

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,660
Or what if you have a mobile app
that helps diabetics track their

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,140
glucose levels, and
you want to store each glucose level and

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,730
the time it was entered?

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,270
You don't store the person's
name with the data, but

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,140
you want to know which data points
came from the same person, so

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,090
you do store an anonymous
ID with each entry.

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,140
Next, suppose you have an online game
and you store things like each time

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,570
a user gains an achievement, kills
an enemy, or advances to the next level.

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,290
Again, you associate this
information with an anonymous ID.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,520
Or suppose you have an online
shopping company, like Amazon, and

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,272
you store the number of purchases made
on your site and the total money spent,

24
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:19,980
broken down by zip code.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,370
Finally, suppose again you have
an online shopping company and

26
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,340
you want to store your users' credit
card information to save it for

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,820
their next visit.

28
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,840
In each case, check the box if
you think the data is sensitive.
