1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,670
Like Diane just mentioned,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,750
there are four broad
categories of summary metrics.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,985
First, there are sums and counts.

4
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:09,900
An example of this type of metric
might be the number of users

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,400
who visited some page.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,450
Second, there are means,
medians and percentiles.

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,000
For example, the mean age of all users
who have completed a certain course or

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,320
the median latency of a page load.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,010
Third, there are probabilities and
rates.

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,460
Like you saw, a probability has 0 or
1 possible outcome in each case.

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,580
For example, did the user
click zero times, or one time?

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,200
Whereas the rate could have zero or
more, for

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,630
example, the user clicks two times or
four times.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,680
Fourth, there are ratios.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,020
These are more general than rates, which
are two counts divided by each other.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,990
A ratio is any two numbers
divided by each other.

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,090
So it could have any value.

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,130
Business metrics often
make sense as ratios.

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,130
For example, you might want
to measure the probability

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,795
that a user clicks a link
that generates revenue,

21
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:03,210
versus the probability that a user
clicks any link on the page.

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,690
Now, let's focus in on the second
category and see how we can choose

23
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,310
between these different options by
looking at the distribution of our data.

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,910
To do that, let's look at an example
of some simulated user data

25
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,050
about how long users spend on
a particular page of the Audacity site.

26
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,030
Here, I've shown a histogram
of the time spent on the page

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,780
where each bar is the frequency.

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,780
So out of 10,000 data points,

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,830
a little less than 3,000
fall in this first bucket.

30
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,660
The mean of this data is about 1.3.

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,230
That is, the average user spends
about 1.3 seconds on this page.

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,128
The median, on the other hand,
is about 0.9.

33
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:41,980
That means 50% of all users spend
less than a second on the page.

34
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,130
The reason for this difference is
all these points off to the right.

35
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,750
They increase the mean proportional to
their size, so if one user stays for

36
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,460
say six seconds, then that outweighs
a few users who don't stay long at all.

37
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,670
This is an example of
an exponential distribution.

38
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,550
If you're thinking about something like,

39
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,400
how many users really get
information from this page,

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,490
you might want to use something
besides the median or the mean.

41
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,449
Maybe the 75th percentile or
the 90th percentile.

42
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,300
In addition to these possible metrics,
you could take this one step further.

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,120
Let's say you find out, in some UER
studies that it would take the average

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,340
person at least three seconds to read
most of the content on the page.

45
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,910
Based on this, you could use as your
metric the percent of users who spend at

46
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,670
least three seconds.

47
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,430
In this case, that would be about 11% of
the data points that stay about three

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,840
seconds or longer.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,470
This metric does have its own problems,
though.

50
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,860
What if you make the page
really confusing?

51
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,660
That could artificially
inflate this metric.
