1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,130
Carrie and Diane, what's the main
advice that you would give to

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,910
analysts as they're
designing their experiments?

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,310
>> I don't mean to sound trite,
but just do it.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,097
Right?
The work that you're going to do in

5
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:13,800
choosing your diversion, in terms of
setting what you need to be consistent?

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,240
Or choosing your population to say
who's actually going to be affected?

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,370
Or the sizing.

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,270
All of that work is going to ensure that
the work that you do in actually running

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,230
the experiment, not to mention the work
that you're putting your users through

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,640
of actually seeing how they're
going to react to those changes,

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,970
all of that isn't wasted.

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,040
So, really, just go through the work
of designing your experiment properly.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,130
>> Yeah,
like we talked about in lesson three,

14
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,030
even if your analytic calculations
don't turn out to be exactly right,

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,690
they really give you a good framework
for starting to understand how

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,400
many users you're going to need, what f,
type of variability you're looking at,

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,490
whether what you're looking at is even
realistic for your user population.

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,940
And that's a great starting point, and

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,660
it forces you to think through
a lot of these issues.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,020
>> Okay, and is there anything in
particular you'd like to call out?

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,030
>> So, what I'd call out is really
the interaction between your choice of

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,680
metrics, that we discussed in lesson
three, with your unit of diversion.

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,940
Some of your metrics may not be valid to
compute given your unit of diversion.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,040
And th-, and what can also happen is
that the variability of your metric can

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,060
really change depending on what you
choose as your unit of diversion.

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,410
The other thing to keep in mind is the,
is always going to be an iterative

27
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,170
process, even if, or especially if,
you're setting up a series of

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,852
experiments or you want to set this
up for your company in general.

29
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:32,350
You're going to go through the process
of trying to figure out what

30
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,290
metrics will work for

31
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,760
you, run a few experiments,
see if you like the results.

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,560
You know, can you really see something?

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,540
And you may have to go back
through this process and

34
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,810
really settle in something that works
for you in terms of your business.

35
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,355
>> Now, we've talked a lot
about building intuition, and

36
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:51,075
what I would say is that the entire
point of building the intuition is that

37
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:53,625
as you're going through this
iterative process, you're

38
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:58,035
able to use your intuition to better
make guesses about what's going to work.

39
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,505
So you basically speed up this process.

40
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:01,395
>> That makes sense.

41
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:02,940
And is there anything else?

42
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,940
>> So the last thing that
I try to point out is that

43
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,370
your choice of unit of diversion and
your choice of population makes for

44
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,260
really good choices about
your invariant choice.

45
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,220
We talked about those a little
bit in lesson three where

46
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,470
you have these metrics that you use as
invariance, or basically sanity checks,

47
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,460
to make sure that your experiment and
your control are run properly.

48
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,330
Well, if you choose a unit
of diversion of cookie and

49
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,140
a population of English, then what you
can do is saying, well, I'm going to

50
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,880
count how many cookies are in English
for both my experiment and my control.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,160
And if those are the same,

52
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,130
then I have some idea that my experiment
has actually been run properly.

53
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,170
>> And this is a really great time
to keep an eye out for surprises.

54
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,360
One of the most common things we
see is people design a feature

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,660
thinking it will only trigger,
you know, 5% of the time on their site.

56
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,840
And then when they do their first
day of an experiment they find

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,880
that the feature is on
80% of all their traffic.

58
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,950
And it's okay to get surprises, but

59
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,220
do keep your eye on the data
as it starts to come in,

60
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,670
because that's a great time to figure
out that something's gone wrong.
