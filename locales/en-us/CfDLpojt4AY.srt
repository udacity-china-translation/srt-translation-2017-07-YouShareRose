1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,690
If everything goes as planned,

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,510
this first change won't have
any user visible changes.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,400
So, it wouldn't be risky at all.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,270
In practice though,

5
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,640
if this kind of change goes wrong,
the effects could be huge.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,130
Your site might go down,
or not work at all.

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,560
Of course, you should always be testing
changes like this, and all changes

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,030
in the controlled development
environment before exposing it to users.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,750
But, sometimes new bugs appear when
the change is exposed to real traffic.

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,720
Because of this, it's often a good
idea to roll out this kind of

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,770
a change to a small percentage of users,
and

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,020
make sure nothing goes wrong,
before rolling it out to everyone.

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,720
The second case is low risk.

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,950
Changing the color a button is innocent
enough that even if all your users saw

15
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,150
the change, it would probably be fine.

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,240
But, of course, as always,

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,255
you should still test the change
before rolling it out to users.

18
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,782
The third case is higher risk,

19
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:47,727
particularly if you end up not
rolling out the experiment.

20
00:00:47,727 --> 00:00:50,453
How are you going to deal with all
these Facebook logins that you're not

21
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:51,535
supporting?

22
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,665
Keeping the affected users
to a small number, so

23
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:57,015
that you won't have very many of these
to deal with, would be a good idea.

24
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,190
Finally, assuming that you've run
similar experiments in the past,

25
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,920
this last case is low risk also, since
most users won't notice ranking changes.

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,100
If this is the first time
you've tested a ranking change,

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,970
though, then this might be risky for
the same reason as the database change.

28
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,700
If there's a bug, the courses might
not appear at all, for example.
