1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,280
In the first case,
the unit of analysis is a pageview.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,050
This doesn't match the unit
of diversion, which usually

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,800
means the analytical estimate will
be an underestimate of the variance.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,960
So, I wouldn't expect the analytic and
empirical variance to match.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,110
In the second case,
the unit of analysis is a cookie.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,690
Or really a daily slice
of the cookie's activity,

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,700
since I said that this metric
was being computed daily.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,400
There isn't really a denominator to this
metric, but since the number of cookies

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,890
is what's being computed,
the cookie is the unit of analysis.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,460
The unit of analysis is larger
than the unit of diversion

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,870
in the sense that one cookie could
generate multiple pageviews.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,590
This is a problem, given that the unit
of diversion is a pageview, because it

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,900
means the same cookie could have events
in both the experiment group, and

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,940
the control group.

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,790
That means this metric is actually not
well defined for this experiment design.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,440
In general,

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,980
you need your unit of diversion to be at
least as big as your unit of analysis.

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,685
In this case, cookie would work
as the unit of diversion, and

19
00:00:55,685 --> 00:01:00,350
user-id would work, since one user-id
can correspond to multiple cookies.

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,650
But usually not vice versa.

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,305
But, event level diversion
is too fine grained here.

22
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:09,180
In the third case,
the unit of analysis is a user-id,

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,470
which matches the unit of diversion.

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,540
You'll never get analytic and
empirical estimates that agree exactly,

25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,110
but they'll probably be
a lot closer in this case.
