1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,600
You keep talking about the population,
but you mentioned cohorts earlier too.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,550
What's the difference?

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,030
>> Well, in the population you
have a whole group of users.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,700
But within that population you can
define what's called a cohort.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,930
And typically, this means people who
enter the experiment at the same time.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,260
So for example,
if you just divert by cookie or

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,250
a user ID, and
you look at this particular country.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,990
Now, you may have all kinds of problems
during the span of your experiment where

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,980
people come who come in
classified as that country,

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,380
either drop out of the experiment, or
potentially even for mechanical reasons,

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,710
like their IP gets reclassified
into a different geographic region.

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,820
So you can lose users,
and gain users, and

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,550
have users who've been exposed to the
experiment for different period of time.

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,650
So cohort usually means that you define
an entering class and you only look at

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,130
users who entered your experiment on
both sides around the same time, and

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,820
you go forward from there.

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,730
You could also use
different information, so

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,840
you don't look at people who join later,
right?

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,820
You start with your initial group, and
you can also use other information.

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,760
Like, if you want to know that oh,

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,390
these are users who've used your site
consistently for the last two months.

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,630
Or who have both a mobile and
a desktop associated with their user ID,

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,210
you can use all of that
to define a cohort.

24
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,540
>> Okay, and when would you want
to use populations versus cohorts?

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,420
>> Well,
cohorts are harder to analyze, and

26
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,310
they're going to take more data
because you'll lose users.

27
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,770
So typically, you only want to use them
when you're looking for user stability.

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,220
So say, you have a learning effect or
you want to measure something like

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,530
increased usage of the site or
increased usage of a mobile device.

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,310
Those are cases where you really
want to see if your change had

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,980
a real effect on their behavior
relative to their history.

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,390
And then you want a cohort.

33
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,070
If you don't need those
types of metrics,

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,220
then you can probably
stick with the population.

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,720
>> Got it.
