00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,860
Suppose that Audacity sometimes
includes promotions for

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,650
their coaching next to the videos
in their free courses.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,630
The promotion might say something like,

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,470
do you need some help
with this material?

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,180
Contact one of our coaches.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,360
They run an experiment changing
the wording of this message and

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,700
they use click-through-rate
as their metric.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,490
Now since the unit of
analysis is a pageview

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,240
Audacity also might want to make
the unit of diversion a pageview.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,200
However, they might also want to
consider using a cookie to get a more

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,780
consistent experience.

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,900
Let's see how that would affect
the size of the experiment.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,630
If you calculate the variability
analytically, it won't change between

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,340
the two units of diversion but
for the cookie-based diversion,

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,580
the analytic estimate is likely
to be an under-estimate.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,440
So Audacity does an empirical estimate
of the variability with 5,000 page

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,800
views in each group.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,890
First they randomly sample by page view
to simulate the unit of diversion being

19
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,030
a pageview and they get
a standard deviation of 0.00515.

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,770
Then they randomly sample by cookie to
get a different set of pageviews and

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,690
the standard deviation is 0.0119.

22
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,500
Now that's quite a difference but

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,530
how will it actually affect
the size of the experiment?

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,080
In order to calculate the size, we can
assume that the standard error for

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,160
the experiment is proportional to one
over the square root of the sample size.

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,720
That means that as you vary the sample
size the standard error would look like

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,000
this for the cookie and
the pageview units of diversion.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,900
As in the graph before, the x axis
is 1 over the square route of N so

29
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,590
the standard error
follows a straight line.

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,230
Using this information about how
the standard error varies with

31
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,060
the sample size, you can calculate
the size that would be needed.

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,580
If you want to see how to do this,
you can look at the r code linked in

33
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,660
the instructor's notes which
will do the calculation.

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,050
In this case, lets say that
the practical significance boundary, or

35
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,160
d min is 0.02.

36
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,420
Then if Audacity used pageview
as the unit of diversion,

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,220
they would need about 2,600
page views to get enough power.

38
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,240
But if they diverted by cookie,
they would need about 13,900 pageviews,

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,430
which is a huge difference.

40
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,400
In cases like these, you probably
need to actually plug the numbers

41
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,180
in to get the exact size, but it's also
important to have an intuition for

42
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,680
how this type of change
will affect sizing.

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,210
That way you can quickly decide which
changes are worth considering and

44
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,650
when you look at your data you know
whether its plausible or not, and

45
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,990
the way to build intuition is
by getting lots of practice.
