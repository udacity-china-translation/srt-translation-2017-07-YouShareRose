1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,490
Are we ready to move on to variability?

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,490
>> Not quite.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,300
First, we have to actually decide how
we're going to compute the comparison.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,430
What we have is, we have a value for
your experiment,

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,030
and you have a value for your control.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,750
But, we have to actually decide, how
are you going to compute the comparison

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,760
between the experiment and the control?

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,430
>> Couldn't you take the difference
like we did in lesson 1?

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,670
>> The simplest way is just
to take the difference.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,001
And, if you're just getting started with
experiments, or you're building up your

11
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,214
knowledge of a whole bunch of different
metrics, that's probably the way to go.

12
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:27,945
>> True.

13
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:31,154
But if you're running lots of
experiments, you may want to consider

14
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:34,380
computing the relative change,
as opposed to the absolute change.

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,020
In other words, the percent change.

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,540
Now, the main advantage of computing the
percent change is that you only have to

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,300
choose one practical significance
boundary, to get stability over time.

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,050
Now, the main situations that I really
see this being applicable are basically

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,160
with regards to seasonality, and
as your system is changing over time.

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,780
So, lets say you have a shopping site,
right?

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,780
And in June, most people are on
vacation, they're not shopping a lot.

22
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,420
So, you have fewer users, you probably
have a lower click-through rate.

23
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,040
Whereas, in December,
you've got loads of users, and

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,990
a much higher click-through rate.

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,680
You, if you have the same practical
significance boundary, and

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,960
across the same times, you can
basically have the same comparison.

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,670
Now, the other situation is that
if you're actually running lots of

28
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,730
experiments, and your system is
actually changing over time,

29
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,280
your metrics are probably
changing over time as well.

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,170
Again, if you're using
the relative difference,

31
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,070
you can stick with one
practical significance boundary

32
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,070
as opposed to having to change
it as your system changes.

33
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,770
>> Right.
The main disadvantage is really

34
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,020
variability.

35
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,880
Ratios, such as relative difference,

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,940
are not always as well behaved
as absolute differences.

37
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,080
So, if you're just
starting out with this, or

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,720
if you have some metrics you
don't understand that well, it's

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,620
often good to start with the absolute
difference, and then work your way up.
