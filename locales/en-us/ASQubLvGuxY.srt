1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,462
So, Diane and Carrie, to start out,
what exactly is A/B testing?

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:07,920
>> So, A/B testing is a general
methodology used online when

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,370
you want to test out a new product or
a feature.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,170
And what you're doing is you're
going to take two sets of users and

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,030
you're going to show one set,
a control set, your existing product or

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,480
a feature, and then another set,
your experiment, the new version.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,170
And what you're going to do is,

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,670
you're going to say,
how did these users respond differently,

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,870
in order to determine which
version of your feature is better?

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,380
>> So, should you use A/B testing for
every change you're considering, or

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,850
are there certain types of
changes it works better for?

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,040
>> So I was talking to John Lilly.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,530
He's a VC at Greylock now, but

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,570
he used to be the CEO of Mozilla,
and he came up with a great analogy.

15
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,350
And his analogy is that A/B
testing is really useful for

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,600
helping you climb to the peak
of your current mountain.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,960
But if you want figure out whether
you want to be on this mountain or

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,880
another mountain,
A/B testing isn't so useful.

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,740
>> Now that said, you can test a pretty
wide variety of things with A/B testing,

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,090
everything from some new features,
additions to your UI,

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,440
different look for your website,
and a lot of companies use it.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,630
So for example, when Amazon
first started doing personalized

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,670
recommendations, they wanted to see
whether people really bought more stuff.

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,350
And they discovered that actually
had a signfiicant increase in

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,220
revenue from the personalized
recommendations.

26
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,150
So, you can use it for
fairly complicated changes.

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,780
Now, Google maybe took it
a little too far sometimes, so

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,697
once we ran 41 different shades of blue
in the UI to see how users responded,

29
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:24,847
if they reacted.

30
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:27,724
And on the one hand it was
interesting and useful internally,

31
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:31,250
but it might have been going a little
too far with those experiments.

32
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,030
>> Maybe, but we can also test
less user visible changes.

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,720
So, for example, ranking changes.

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,090
LinkedIn tested a change where they were
trying to figure out whether they should

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,400
show a news article or an encouragement
to basically add new contacts.

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,840
That's a ranking change.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,040
Google does a lot of ranking,
between our search lists and

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,520
our ads, we test all of those
changes also via A/B testing.

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,560
>> You can also test changes that you're
not even sure a user would notice.

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,740
So for example, 100 milliseconds is
not a lot of page load time, but,

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,150
both Amazon and
Google have run experiments.

42
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,690
Amazon showed in 2007 that, for every
100 milliseconds they added to the page,

43
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,930
they actually had a 1%
decrease in revenue.

44
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,010
And for Google,
we have similar results, that you find,

45
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,700
even though 100 milliseconds doesn't
seem like that much, on average,

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,130
the number of queries people
do actually decreases for

47
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,830
every 100 milliseconds
of latency that you add.

48
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,960
>> Wow, so those are some things
you can learn from A/B testing.

49
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,443
What are some things you
can't do with A/B testing?

50
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:32,860
>> A/B testing isn't as useful
testing out new experiences.

51
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,210
And you can sort of think about
this in the obvious way, right?

52
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,630
You know, you're testing a new
experience and you've got an existing

53
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,993
set of users and they are like, hey,
you just changed my experience,

54
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:45,299
what happened, I liked my old way and
I'm kind of like grrr, right?

55
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,840
That's called change aversion.

56
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,940
The other thing is that they can
be like, oh, well, this is new,

57
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,150
and they test out everything.

58
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,340
That's called a novelty effect, right?

59
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,620
And so what happens in a new experience
is there are sort of like two issues.

60
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,650
One is a question of,
what is your baseline for comparison?

61
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,420
But two is a question about
how much time you need

62
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,070
In order to actually have your
users adapt to the new experience,

63
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,380
so that you can actually say what is
going to be the plateaued experience so

64
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,600
that I can actually
make a robust decision.

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,730
>> Yeah, and time can be a problem for
other reasons.

66
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,290
So, for example, if you have a website
that recommends apartment rentals.

67
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,340
People don't look for
apartments that often, and

68
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,530
what you really want is return business,
or maybe you want to grow your business

69
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,390
by referrals to other people
who like your service.

70
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,130
And the reality is, in the scope of an
experiment it's going to be really hard

71
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,180
to measure whether people actually
come back to you from more referrals.

72
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,310
And even if they refer their friends,

73
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,790
well, honestly is it
going to be next week?

74
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,630
Is it going to be six months from now?

75
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,990
So, there's certain things that you
may want to know about your site,

76
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,920
that are pretty difficult to get at,
through short term A/B testing, and

77
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,010
we'll talk in lesson three
about some options for

78
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,260
coming up with some metrics that
are good proxies for that kind of thing.

79
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,817
>> So the last example that we'll give
for when A/B testing isn't as useful,

80
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:02,331
is that A/B testing can't really tell
you if you're missing something.

81
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:04,360
So, let's say you're on
a digital camera review site.

82
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,367
A/B testing can tell you whether or

83
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:09,605
not you should be showing this camera
review above this camera review, but

84
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:13,090
A/B testing can't really tell you if
you're missing this entire other camera

85
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,480
that you should be reviewing but
you aren't reviewing at all.

86
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,980
>> Got it.
