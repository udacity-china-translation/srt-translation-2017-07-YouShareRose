1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:03,680
Carrie, what can you do if you want to
use one of these more difficult metrics

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,540
like a median or

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,280
ratio or anything where you can't
calculate the variants analytically?

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,200
>> Well, we're going to talk in
a minute about specifically computing

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,620
the variants empirically, but
there's actually a broader class of

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,420
methods here called
non-parametric methods.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,810
That means that you have a way to
analyze the data without making

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,660
an assumption about what
the distribution Is.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,310
Now, these methods can be noisier,
and they can be more computationally

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,420
intensive, but
they can also be very useful.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,030
>> Interesting.

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,530
So, what's an example of that?

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,970
>> Well, a great simple example
is called the sign test.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,990
Now, let's imagine that we ran our
AB experiment for 20 days, and

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,980
on 15 of those days,

16
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,680
the experiment side had a higher
measurement than the control side.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,740
Now, that seems unlikely to
have arrived by chance, and

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,640
what you can do is use what we learned
in Lesson One about the binomial

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,220
to actually calculate how likely
it is that that occurred,

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,170
if there was really no difference
between the two sides.

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,470
Now, the downside of doing this is
that it doesn't help you estimate

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,879
the size of the effect.

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,340
That is, you can't say, you know,

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,570
I'm confident this is at
least 2% change in my metric.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,700
The upside is,
it's pretty easy to do, and

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,830
you can do it under a lot
of different circumstances.

27
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,770
>> Okay, so if you wanted to launch any
positive change in your experiment,

28
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,920
then you could figure out whether
there was one using a sign test.

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,340
>> Right, and we'll talk a little
further about that in Lesson Five.

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,330
>> But, like you mentioned in Lesson
One, sometimes you won't want to launch

31
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,340
unless you meet some threshold,
your practical significance level.

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,510
So, what then?

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,110
>> Right.
Well,

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,070
later in the lesson we're going to
talk about how to actually compute

35
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,010
the variance empirically,
from the sample data.

36
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,380
Once you've done that,
you have two choices.

37
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,240
First, if you look at your summary
statistic distribution, and

38
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,270
it's pretty nice and normal,
you can do what we've done for

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,090
more normally-distributed metrics and
use a normal conference interval just

40
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,890
with the variants you
estimated empirically.

41
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,590
If your data's a little
funnier than that, or

42
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,840
if you want to be really robust,
you can actually go ahead and

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,350
compute a non-parametric
conference interval.

44
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,330
It's pretty easy to do,
and go ahead in that way.
