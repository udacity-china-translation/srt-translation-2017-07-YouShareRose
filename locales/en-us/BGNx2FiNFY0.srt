1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,260
I would choose the null hypothesis that
both groups have the same probability of

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,090
completing a checkout.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,930
And I would choose
an alternative hypothesis

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,480
that the two groups have a different
probability of completing a checkout.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,660
We could also say as we did before,

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,630
that the null hypothesis is that
px minus p comp is equal to zero.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,300
And then the alternative hypothesis
would be that the difference is

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,260
not equal to zero.
