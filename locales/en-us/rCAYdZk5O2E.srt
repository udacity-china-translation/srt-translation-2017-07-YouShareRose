1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,890
So what happens if one of
your sanity checks fails?

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,860
>> Well it's kind of like monopoly.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,560
If your sanity checks fail,
do not pass go.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,990
Do not proceed, go straight to
analyzing why your sanity checks fail.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,340
You really have to debug and

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,920
understand what's going on before you
can actually analyze your experiment.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,050
Because, if you try and

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,410
move on past that, your conclusions
are almost certainly wrong.

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,820
>> Okay, so
how do you figure out what went wrong?

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,466
>> Well, there's a couple different
avenues that you can try.

11
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:29,320
First, something might have
gone wrong technically, and

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,080
you want to work with your
engineers to understand,

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,730
is there something going on with
the experiment infrastructure?

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,590
Did I get the experiment
set up correctly?

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,410
Is something wrong with
experiment diversion?

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,240
You really want to debug the experiment
setup with the engineers.

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,570
The second thing that you can try and
do is a retrospective analysis.

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,460
Try and recreate experiment
diversion from the data capture,

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,740
and understand that this is something
endemic to what you're trying to

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,890
do that may be causing the situation.

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,720
The third thing is,
we can try and use those pre and

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,840
those post periods we talked
about earlier in lesson four.

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,730
Right?

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,480
If you're in a pre-period,
then you can say,

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,870
did I see the same changes in
those invariance in my pre-period?

26
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,470
If I saw them in the pre-period and
the experiment, that points to a problem

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,780
with the experiment infrastructure,
the set up, something along those lines.

28
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,760
On the other hand, if you see
the change only in your experiment but

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,580
not in the pre-period, that points to
something with the experiment itself,

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,390
maybe the data capture or
something along those lines.

31
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,790
>> Okay, what are the most
common reasons you've seen for

32
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,660
data not matching up like this?

33
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,540
>> Well, the most common one that I
really see is data capture, especially

34
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,750
when you want to capture a new
experience that the user is undergoing.

35
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,810
Right?
And so

36
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,470
maybe you just didn't
capture it correctly.

37
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,550
Maybe the change triggers very rarely,
and you capture it

38
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,760
correctly in the experiment, but you
don't capture quickly in the control,

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,870
and so
you're not comparing like with like.

40
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,280
That's probably the most common.

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,060
But other reasons could be,
the experiment's set up.

42
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,410
So, for example, what happens if
you have a filter to English only?

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,200
Maybe you set up for the experiment,
but not the control, and

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,330
now your publishes aren't comparable.

45
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,770
More rarely, it could be your
infrastructure, or the ex, you know,

46
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,990
the experiment system,
something along those lines.

47
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,190
Maybe there's something going on to
really sort of reset cookies, and

48
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,889
that's what's sort of
screwing things up.

49
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,980
You just have to go through and
test all of them.

50
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,650
>> Okay.

51
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,410
And is it ever just a real difference?

52
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,330
>> It could be, but
it's probably not a good thing if it is.

53
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,400
For example, there's something in the
infrastructure that's going on to cause

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,990
the cookies to churn.

55
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,040
You probably don't want that,

56
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,750
your user's probably not
having a good experience, and

57
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,000
it's not good for the experiment itself.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,750
Right?

59
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,640
Now the key thing to remember is
that all of these comparisons,

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,570
they're approximations.

61
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,590
So you're not going to get
an exactly the same number.

62
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,870
It's just going to be
approximately the same.

63
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,600
The other thing that I get asked a lot
is, well, maybe my users are learning

64
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,170
over time, maybe it's, you know,
users are adapting to the change.

65
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,890
Now, the key thing there is that,
if there really is a learning effect,

66
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,750
then you're going to see not very
much change in the beginning,

67
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,660
and it's going to be
increasing over time.

68
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,798
So if you're seeing a big change
right from the beginning,

69
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:03,740
it's probably not a learning effect.

70
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,180
>> Okay.
And then if all the sanity checks do

71
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,670
pass, then we can
analyze the experiment.

72
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,030
>> Yes.
Then you can analyze the experiment.
