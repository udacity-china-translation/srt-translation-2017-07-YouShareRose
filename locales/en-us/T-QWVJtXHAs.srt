1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,260
To calculate the confidence interval,
first I'll

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,590
estimate the probability of a success,
which will be the point estimate.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,967
That will be 300 divided by 2000,
which comes to 0.15.

4
00:00:11,967 --> 00:00:16,260
So, 0.15 will be at the center
of the confidence interval.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,390
Next, I'll calculate
the margin of error.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,280
To do that, I'll need the z-score,

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,241
and it turns out that the value
is between 2.57 and 2.58.

8
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:28,942
You could really use either and it
wouldn't matter much, but I'll use 2.58.

9
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:33,131
And then that will need to be
multiplied by the standard error,

10
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:37,174
which is the square root of p hat,
times 1 minus p hat over N.

11
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:39,790
And that comes out to about 0.021.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,230
Now, to get the upper bound, we add the
margin of error to the point estimate,

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,869
which gives 0.171, and to get the lower
bound we subtract, which gives 0.129.
