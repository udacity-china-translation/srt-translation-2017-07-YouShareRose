1
00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:06,214
At a 95% confidence level or
an alpha of 0.05, the Z-score is 1.96.

2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:10,005
I'll multiply this Z-score by each
standard error to get the margin of

3
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,480
error in each case.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,540
Now, for the first case, the margin
of error is smaller than the observed

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,790
difference, which means the confidence
interval won't include zero.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,850
So, the difference is significant.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,930
In the second two cases, the margin of
error is also smaller than the magnitude

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,410
of the observed difference.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,140
So, these changes are significant also.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,290
In the last case, the margin of error is
wider than the observed difference, so

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,950
this is not statistically significant.

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,090
Using the Bonferroni method,
I get an individual Z-score of 2.5.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,450
It's actually between 2.49 and 2.5, but
it's closer to 2.5, so i'll use that.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,520
To get this,
I divided the overall alpha of .05 by 4,

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,530
and looked up the result
in a Z-score table.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,380
Multiplying this by the standard errors,
I get these margins of error.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,080
Now, it turns out that each margin
of error is now larger than

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,050
the corresponding difference, so

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,220
none of these metrics have a significant
change using the Bonferroni method.

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,920
In this case, the Bonferroni method
is probably too conservative.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,720
If the course description was
an improvement, then it makes

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,340
sense that it could cause more than
one of these metrics to move and

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,350
they're probably more
likely to move together.
