1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,390
All right.
We've gone over some ways of coming up

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,200
with high level concepts for
our metrics.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,030
What issues do you run into when
you go to actually compute that?

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,080
>> So, what we have so far is really
a high level concept for a metric.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,200
To move from that to a fully realized
definition, there are two main steps.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,810
The first step is to fully
define exactly what data

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,880
we're going to look at to
actually compute the metric.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,832
This can be something as simple as which
events do I count in my numerator and

9
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:26,910
my denominator.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,720
It can also be questions like am
I going to filter the data at all

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,370
to remove robots or spam or
things along those lines.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,610
And the second step is given those
events, how do I summarize my metric?

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,370
Am I computing an average,
am I computing a median?

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,890
We'll look at some very
simple summer statistics plus

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,160
also some much more complicated ones.

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,280
Now the reality is that as you're going
through these steps what you're really

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,820
doing is you're building intuition about
your metric, and about your data and

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,880
about your systems.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,580
The mark of a really good
analyst is whether or

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,590
not you understand what
changes in your data and

21
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,170
in your metrics, you're system can and
can't produce, right?

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,110
So, as an example, I know that if I see
a 10% change in click-through rate,

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,900
that is wholly unrealistic.

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,870
And realistically I probably
have a bug in my experiment

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,180
as opposed to a real true change that
led to a 10% change in click through.

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,240
That's just utterly unrealistic.

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,410
>> Okay, so how would you
actually go about doing this?

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,670
Say, for example, click through
probability from lesson one.

29
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,920
How would we compute that?

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,700
>> Well, we have to first decide,

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,580
given the events that we observe, which
ones were actually going to count for

32
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,790
those metrics and
how we're going to combine them.

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,560
So, as an example, even for
click-through probability,

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,190
there's probably a few
different ways to compute it.

35
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,110
One is to count total number of clicks
and total of number of page views and

36
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,470
just divide total clicks divided
by the total page views.

37
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,430
Now, we can do a more nuanced
version of that as well.

38
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,720
So there's something called a cookie
which is an anonymous identifier for

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,410
a user.

40
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,640
It's not really a user but
we can, we like to pretend.

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,060
And what we can do instead is say,
did a cookie visit the site, and then,

42
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,150
given that a cookie visited,
did they click or not?

43
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,788
Now, these different metrics, you know,
one's a rate and one's a probability,

44
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,530
they have different semantic meanings,
but they also impact the act,

45
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,900
the actual implementation of metric as
well as things like the variability,

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,470
which we'll talk about
a little bit later.

47
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,620
>> So you also have to worry about
a bunch of other detailed things

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,190
that come up.

49
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,760
So, for example, if you have a page
load, and then no click, but

50
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,520
then a day later the same cookie comes
back, loads the page, waits 15 minutes,

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,700
and then clicks.

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,490
Is 15 minutes too long?

53
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,680
Is the day too long?

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,480
Do you consider them all being
associated with the same record?

55
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,030
There's a lot of these little
things that you have to look at.

56
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,050
And depending how much data you have,
you may want to plot your data

57
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,280
over the course of a day, look at
evening, you know weekday effects.

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,370
Look at the week, maybe even
look at the minute or the hour,

59
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,790
where things are happening.

60
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,660
So, you have to ask questions such as,

61
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,730
what happens if someone arrives
at your website at 11:50 p.m.

62
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,041
And then clicks at 12:01 a.m.

63
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,090
Now do you count that as being
part of the first day's data?

64
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,975
Do you completely
separate the two events?

65
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:10,550
Or do you count it as part
of the second day's data?

66
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,730
And although those events in
aggregate can be pretty small,

67
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,240
if you actually plot your data
over the course of a day,

68
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,130
you will see this big
dip around midnight.

69
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,870
>> I've totally seen that before.

70
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,604
Now, what's interesting is that you have
to also consider the technology that's

71
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,912
used when you're actually
capturing the events.

72
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:31,889
So, as an example, JavaScript pings,
which send a 204 request,

73
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,003
are one of the most common ways
of actually capturing clicks.

74
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:39,339
Now, the issue is that certain browsers,
for example,

75
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:43,313
very old browsers, don't,
don't implement JavaScript at all.

76
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:47,195
And then other browsers, you know,
so, for example IE versus Safari,

77
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:50,930
will have different failure rates
on that JavaScript ping back.

78
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,610
And so what can happen is that as
you look at different browsers or

79
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,040
different platforms, you'll actually
get very different click-through rates.

80
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,210
And it's not because the actual
click-through rates are different, but

81
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,070
it's because the technology that you
use in order to gather the clicks

82
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,180
is actually different.

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,890
And so in those cases you have to
really work with your engineering team

84
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,650
to understand all of those nuances,
understand when you have a real

85
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,530
difference, versus the difference
through the underlying technology.

86
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,860
>> Wow, who have guessed it's so
much trouble to count clicks correctly.
