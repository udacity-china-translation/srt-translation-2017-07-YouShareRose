1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,640
The graph of click through rate over
time might look something like this.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,230
Now, there are some interesting
patterns in this graph.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,020
You can see both weekly and
daily variation as

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,020
people are more likely to click through
either in the evening or on the weekend.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,990
But this graph can't help us answer
our original question, which is,

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,250
is there a problem with
the click tracking?

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,160
Like I mentioned, you can't really tell
if this is how high the rate actually is

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,070
or if it's being artificially inflated
by double clicks being recorded.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,040
The click-through-probability over
time might look something like this.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,940
It looks pretty similar to the rate.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,240
And again, it's hard to tell by this
graph alone whether there's a problem.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,400
Now lets take a look at both the rate
and the probability on the same graph.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,560
You can see that the rate
is consistently higher

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,430
than the probability.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,930
But that's to be expected whether
there's a problem or not and

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,710
it's hard to know how much higher
you would expect the rate to be.

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,740
The difference is also
consistent over time, so

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,500
it's hard to see whether
there is a problem.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,490
Now let's take a look at
click-through-rate by platform.

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,840
Now this graph is pretty suspicious,

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,280
because it shows the click-through-rate
being higher on mobile than on desktop.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,480
But users will have different behavior
on desktop than on mobile so,

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,130
it's still not really clear that this
is a problem with the JavaScript

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,400
tracking and
not just a difference in user behavior.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,800
You might think the direction of this
is the opposite of what you'd expect.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,730
Like maybe you'd expect that the
click-through-rate would be higher on

27
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,180
desktop than mobile.

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,850
But it can be pretty hard to
predict things like that.

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,950
So right now, this graph doesn't really
give us enough information to be

30
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,550
certain that there's a problem,
although it is suspicious.

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,030
Now if you plot,
click-through-probability by platform,

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,990
you won't see anything suspicious since,

33
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,370
if JavaScript does
send a duplicate ping.

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,450
The click-through probability will
eliminate that, collapsing it into one.

35
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,460
So here we see that the probability
is fairly similar between

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,850
desktop and mobile.

37
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,480
Which is maybe what you
would have expected.

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,600
So again, we can't tell
whether there was a problem.

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,370
Finally, if plot both rate and

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,470
probability by platform,
you can clearly see the problem.

41
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,585
The click-through-probability is
actually slightly lower on mobile,

42
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,792
but the click-through-rate
is significantly higher.

43
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:15,198
You won't necessarily be able to narrow
it down to duplicate JavaScript pings at

44
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:16,104
this point, but

45
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:19,900
this point's pretty clearly to some
sort of instrumentation issue.

46
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,380
This is a good time to talk to
your engineers about what could be

47
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,920
going wrong.

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,980
So to summarize,

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,622
only the final graph really made it
crystal clear that there was a problem.

50
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:32,010
The click-through-rate by platform
looked a little suspicious, but

51
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,870
it was hard to draw a conclusion
from just that graph on its own.
