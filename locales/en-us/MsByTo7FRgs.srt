1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,550
Okay, we've talked about how to size
our experiment, what comes next?

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,689
>> Well we have to translate our ideal
size into a set of practical decisions.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,450
First of all, what's the duration of
the experiment that I want to run?

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,750
Secondly, when do I want
to run the experiment?

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,200
Is, you know,
back to school a good time to run it?

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,338
What about holidays?

7
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:19,860
Is it going to overlap
something that's important and

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,090
then third you have to think about what
fraction of your traffic you're going to

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,970
send through the experiment.

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,120
Those are all interrelated as they
get you to the ideal size but

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,170
you need to think about them
a little bit separately.

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,210
>> The fist two make sense.

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,750
Could you go over the last
one a little bit more?

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,290
>> Sure.

15
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,250
So what's that your unit
of diversion is a cookie.

16
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,160
And so what we're really
asking is on any given day

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,860
what proportion or what percentage of
the cookies are you sending to your

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,871
experiment and your control?

19
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,435
Now, let's say we're and we need 1
million cookies in our experiment and

20
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:51,160
our control combined.

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,850
Now, if you only get a 100,000 cookies
visiting your site on any given day.

22
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,690
That means that if you
want to run 50% of

23
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,645
your traffic through the experiment and

24
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:05,360
50% through the control, you need to run
your experiment control for ten days.

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,010
Now, another choice is to run
your experiment at 25% each, say,

26
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,010
it's because you want
to run another test,

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,060
then you'd have to run your experiment
for 20 days as opposed to 10.

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,560
And that's how, the duration of your
experiment, is related to the proportion

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,840
of traffic that you're sending
through your experiment.

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,530
Okay, why wouldn't you always
run on all of your traffic so

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,150
you can get results quicker?

32
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,810
>> Well,
there's a couple of different reasons.

33
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,140
The first, which we've
touched on before, is safety.

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,370
So basically, you may have a new UI
feature, and you're not sure either how

35
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,630
well it functions in all browsers,
or I mean, hopefully you know.

36
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,220
But you may want to test it.

37
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,530
Or how your users are going to react.

38
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,250
So they might get frustrated with it.

39
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,360
It might not work that well.

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,607
So you might want to actually keep
the site mostly the same, and

41
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:49,950
only expose a few people to it until
you feel more comfortable with it.

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,210
The other reason would
be something like press.

43
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,390
Let's say it's a new feature.

44
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,620
You're not really sure
you're going to keep it.

45
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,760
Do you really want a lot of people
seeing this and potentially blogging

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,110
about if you're not sure it's even going
to be the way you go with the site?

47
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,550
>> So, another reason is that right now
we're randomizing across the unit of

48
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,979
diversion, but the question is what

49
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,470
other things are actually impacting
the variability of your results?

50
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,050
Carrie mentioned something at the
beginning of this video which is about

51
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,290
you know,
what if it ran on a holiday, right?

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,244
Well, you know,
if you're running a 50-50 experiment,

53
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:24,740
then you can gather all data on a single
day, would you actually want to

54
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,390
make a decision based on
a single day if it was a holiday?

55
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,340
Well, a more common scenario is that you
have to have very different behavior

56
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,710
on weekdays and weekends.

57
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,555
And so you might actually prefer to run
at a smaller percentage across multiple

58
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:40,992
days to get a sense for how the
differences are by week day and weekend,

59
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:44,777
across holidays, by different times of
day, all of those different types of

60
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:49,440
things that you are actually accounting
for those other sources of variability.

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,750
>> And the other option is, you may be
running multiple tasks at your company

62
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,900
or you may be running multiple tasks
of the same feature with you know,

63
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,840
different levels of a parameter or
different types of the same feature?

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,230
And if you really want those things to
be directly comparable, the easiest

65
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,660
thing to do is to run them at the same
time on smaller percentages of traffic.

66
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,930
And then you know that if one of
the tests was affected by a holiday or

67
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,530
a strange shift in your traffic,
they all were, and you should be able to

68
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,278
compare the relative ordering
of the tests against each other.

69
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:18,169
>> Got it.
