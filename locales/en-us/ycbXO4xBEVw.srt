1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,120
Like Diane said, changing the unit of
diversion can change the variability of

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,580
a metric, sometimes pretty dramatically.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,490
I Googled Diane and

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,850
some of her colleagues tested this by
measuring the variability of a metric

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,530
for two different units of diversion,
query and cookie.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,930
Diverting by query is a type of
event based diversion, since for

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,630
a search engine,
a query really is an event.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,040
The metric they measured
was called coverage,

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,000
which is defined as the percentage
of queries for which an ad is shown.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,520
You can calculate this by taking the
total number of queries with an ad and

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,729
dividing by the total number of queries.

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,910
Since the number of queries
is the denominator,

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,070
that means that the unit of
analysis in this case is a query.

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,650
So when the unit of diversion was
a query, then the unit of diversion and

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,780
the unit of analysis were the same.

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,650
This plot shows the results Diane saw,
with the standard error on

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,530
the Y-axis and 1 over the square root
of the sample size on the X-axis.

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,879
The red line shows the standard
error for cookie-based diversion and

19
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,690
the black line shows the standard
error for query-based diversion.

20
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,480
To see why the X-axis is 1
over the square root of N,

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,530
instead of N directly,
recall that the standard error for

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,250
a binomial is proportional to
1 over the square root of N.

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,780
That's why both lines here are straight.

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,060
Notice that when the unit
of diversion is a cookie,

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,690
which is not the same as
the unit of analysis,

26
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,860
the variability is much higher than
when the two units are the same.

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,560
The variability might be higher
by as much as four times,

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,370
depending on the sample size.

29
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,210
The standard error for

30
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,690
the query based diversion was also much
closer to the analytical standard error.

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,350
This lines up with what Diane mentioned
earlier, that when your unit of analysis

32
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,700
and your unit of diversion are the same,
the variability tends to be lower and

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,900
closer to the analytical estimate
than when they're different.

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,090
If you'd like to see more
details about these results,

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,540
see the paper linked in
the instructor's notes.

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,390
Now for each of the following cases,

37
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,040
would you expect the analytic variance
to match the empirical variance?

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,410
First, suppose your metric
is click-through-rate,

39
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,970
defined as the number of clicks divided
by the number of page views, and

40
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,570
suppose your unit of
diversion is a cookie.

41
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,380
Second, suppose your metric is
the number of cookies that view your

42
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,560
homepage, which you're
computing on a daily basis.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,960
You're using event based diversion, and
in this case, an event is a page view.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,070
Third, suppose your metric is
the percent of users that sign up for

45
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,330
coaching, that is the total
number of users who sign up for

46
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,560
coaching, divided by the total number of
users who are enrolled in any course,

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,860
all within a one-week period.

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,190
And you're diverting based on user ID.

49
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,980
In each case, check the box if
you think the analytical and

50
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,410
the empirical variance would match.
