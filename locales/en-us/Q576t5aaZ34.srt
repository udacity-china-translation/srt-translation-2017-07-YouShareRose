1
00:00:00,145 --> 00:00:02,319
>> Okay.
We can use hypothesis testing to see

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,235
whether a difference we observe in our
experiment is actually significant.

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:07,315
What comes next?

4
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:11,233
>> So what we have to do next is decide
from a business perspective, what change

5
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:15,108
in the click-through probability
ability is practically significant.

6
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,208
In other words,
what size change matters to us?

7
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,027
>> Well, as a statistician would say,

8
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:22,618
what's substantive in addition to
being statistically significant.

9
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:24,904
>> That's the difference
between what engineers say and

10
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:26,001
what statisticians say.

11
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,820
Substantive and practically
significant mean the exact same thing.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,609
>> Okay.

13
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:34,018
So why can't we say that every
change matters to the business?

14
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:36,968
Can't we launch any experiment
that makes any difference at all?

15
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:40,538
>> Well, you could, but you might not
want to for a variety of reasons.

16
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:43,746
One, there might be an investment
in making the change itself, so

17
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:47,067
it might not be worth it to you or
you might just want to wait for the next

18
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:50,885
change, thinking that maybe you could
do well here, but you could do better.

19
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,386
So, in something like medicine,

20
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,835
you always want to be clear
that it's worth the change.

21
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:58,940
If you're testing a new drug, maybe
patient's respond a little bit better,

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,738
but you're going to have to
invest in training nurses,

23
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,372
actually launching the drug.

24
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:04,370
All these other things.

25
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,971
So you may want to have a higher level
of practical significance to justify

26
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,751
changing the treatment protocol.

27
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:12,715
>> Now this is one major difference
between the online world and

28
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:14,873
sort of the traditional sciences, right?

29
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:18,251
In medicine,
you probably want a 5%, a 10%,

30
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:21,093
a 15% change to really be substantive.

31
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:22,966
Right?
At Google, for example,

32
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:27,520
a 1 or a 2% change in click-through
probabilities is actually quite large.

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,786
And so
the differences in the magnitudes for

34
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:33,002
what's consider practically
significant can be quite different.

35
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:36,500
>> Yeah, so what you really want
to observe is repeatability.

36
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,110
Statistical significance
is about repeatability.

37
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,180
>> And you want to make sure when you
setup your experiment that you get that

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,483
guarantee that yes,
these results are repeatable so

39
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,085
it's statistically significant.

40
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:49,586
But you also want to make sure that if
you see a change in your experiment that

41
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:52,145
you're interested in from
a business standpoint, so

42
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,728
it's practically significant,
it's also statistically significant.

43
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:59,613
So you want to size your experiment
appropriately, such that the statistical

44
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:03,393
significance bar is actually lower
than the practical significance bar.

45
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:04,205
>> That makes sense.

46
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:05,781
So then, so the audacity example,

47
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:08,365
we still need to pick a practical
significance boundary.

48
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:09,073
>> That's right.

49
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:12,164
So let's say that from
a business perspective, a 2%

50
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:16,950
change in the click-through probability
would be practically significant.
