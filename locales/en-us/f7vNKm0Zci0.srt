1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,160
In the first case, users probably won't
consciously notice if the video load

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,420
time is a bit faster or slower, so event
based diversion would probably be okay.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,380
Like Diane mentioned, you may have some
learned effects in this case even if

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,730
users don't consciously
notice the change,

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,180
in which case you would need to switch
to cookie based diversion, but event

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,190
based should be a good starting point,
particularly for a short experiment.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,310
In the second case, it would be pretty
distracting if the button looked

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,880
different every time you
reloaded the page, so

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,040
event based diversion
wouldn't be a good idea here.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,760
Cookie based diversion
is probably good enough.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,490
If the button looks different on
different devices, that's okay,

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,735
since the UI usually looks a little bit
different on different devices anyway.

13
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:45,860
In the third case, like the first, most
users won't notice ranking changes, so

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,760
event based diversion is
a good place to start.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,040
Again, you might need to change this
to cookie based diversion if you notice

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,220
a learned effect.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,135
The fourth case is something that
users will almost certainly notice.

18
00:00:56,135 --> 00:01:00,360
Cross-device consistency will also be
important here, if you want to be able

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,660
to determine whether the change
impacts the pass rate of the quiz.

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,870
If a student watches the video on their
phone, then completes the quiz on their

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,220
computer, for example, you'll need them
to be in the same group both times.

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,370
Because of this, you'll need to
use user-ID based diversion here.
