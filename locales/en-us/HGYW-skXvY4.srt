1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,680
Now, let's look at how to compute
the confidence interval for our sample.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,810
We've already found
the center of the interval,

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,939
that is a probability of a click.

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,901
The equation was p hat, or the estimated
probability equals X over N,

5
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:14,451
where X was the number
of users who clicked and

6
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:17,425
N was the total number of
users who visited the page.

7
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:22,778
In this example,
p hat is 100 over 1000, or 0.1.

8
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:26,500
So, the center of the confidence
interval will be 0.1.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,870
Next, I want to calculate the width
of the confidence interval,

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,950
which is also called
the margin of error, or m.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,900
To do this,

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,720
I'll need to use the standard error
of the binomial distribution.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,240
Recall that if the sample
is large enough,

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,380
instead of using
the binomial distribution,

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,750
I can assume the distribution is normal,
like this blue line.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,050
A good rule of thumb is that if
N times p hat is greater than 5,

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,450
it's safe to assume
a normal distribution.

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,420
You should also check that N times
1 minus p hat, is greater than 5.

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,310
But, for small click-through
probabilities like we usually see,

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,690
this is the more stringent condition.

21
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,690
In our case, N times p hat is 100, so
the assumption should be safe here.

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,750
When we can use the normal
approximation, then the width of

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,420
the confidence interval, that is
the margin of error, will be equal

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,810
to the z-score of the confidence level,
times the standard error.

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,380
And for the binomial distribution,

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,750
the standard error's the square root
of p hat times 1 minus p hat over N.

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,450
If you look at this formula,
you'll notice a few things.

28
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,550
The amount of random variation
we expect in our sample,

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,420
the width of the confidence interval,

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,630
is a function of both the proportion of
successes and the size of the sample.

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,000
This means we need to consider the
proportion of successes when we decide

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,570
how many samples to collect, which we'll
talk about again later this lesson.

33
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,710
When the success probability
is farther from 0.5 then

34
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,820
the standard error will be smaller,
which means the distribution is tighter,

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,570
which means the confidence
interval will be smaller.

36
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,150
Similarly, if the number of samples
is larger, the standard error and

37
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,140
the confidence interval
will also be smaller.

38
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,116
Now I'll need to find the z-score for

39
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:04,610
the boundary of a 95%
confidence interval.

40
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,479
For a normal distribution with a mean
of 0 and a standard deviation of 1,

41
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,050
which is also called a z distribution.

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,814
With 95% confidence,
the true value would be within 1.96 and

43
00:02:17,814 --> 00:02:21,578
negative 1.96 of
the estimate we observed.

44
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:24,310
The value 1.96 is called a z-score, and

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,740
you can look it up in a table like the
one linked in the instructor's notes.

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,613
In this case,
since we're doing a two-tailed test,

47
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:33,493
each tail will contain
2.5% of the distribution.

48
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:39,595
So 1.96 is the z-score for
97.5%, or 100 minus 2.5.

49
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:44,440
In our case, the margin of
error comes out to about 0.019.

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,365
So, we'll add this margin of error to
the point estimate to get the upper

51
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:54,388
bound of 0.119, and subtract to
get the lower bound of 0.081.

52
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:58,901
This means, if you'd run the experiment
again with another thousand page views,

53
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:02,705
you'd maybe expect to see between 80 and
120 clicks, but more or

54
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:05,108
less than that would
be pretty surprising.

55
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:09,128
Now, let's say you made a similar
measurement on a different page,

56
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:13,234
and this time you got 2000 total
users and 300 of them clicked.

57
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,670
And let's say,
you wanted a 99% confidence level.

58
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,880
Calculate the upper and lower bounds
of the confidence interval, and

59
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,200
write the numbers in these
boxes to three decimal places.

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,970
To do this,
you'll need a z-score table, and

61
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,540
you can find a link to one
in the instructor's notes.

62
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,100
Again, you should use a two-tailed test.
