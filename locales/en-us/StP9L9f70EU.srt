1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,070
Carey, first let's suppose you
have a single evaluation metric,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,270
what do you do then?

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,070
>> Well, the goal is to make
a business decision about whether your

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,110
experiment has favorably
impacted your metrics.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,650
Analytically, that means you
want to decide if you've observed

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,210
a statistically significant
result of your experiment.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,280
Now, typically we also want
to estimate the magnitude and

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,180
the direction of the change.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,460
Then once you have all that information
you can make a decision about whether

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,710
you want to recommend that your business
actually launch this experiment.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,010
>> Let's talk about the first piece.

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,020
How do you decide if the change
was statistically significant?

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,490
>> Well we're really just putting
together all the pieces we've talked

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,138
about earlier.

15
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:36,030
In Lesson 3,

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,020
we talked about characterizing the
metric, understanding how it behaves.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,660
And in Lesson 4, we used that
information about variability

18
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,550
to estimate how long we needed
to run the experiment for and

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,800
size our experiment appropriately.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,490
Now we're going to use the results
of both of those steps

21
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,460
to try to estimate the variability we
need to analyze the A B experiment as we

22
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,910
talked about at way back at
the beginning of the course.

23
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,290
>> And what if our results are not
statistically significant?

24
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,610
What do you do then?

25
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,569
>> Well that's a good time to take
a much longer look at your results,

26
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,600
especially if you were expecting
a really noticeable difference.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,940
So for example, you might want to break
it down into different platforms,

28
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,420
different days of the week.

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,950
This can not only help you find bugs in
your experiment setup, but it might give

30
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,210
you a new hypothesis about how people
are reacting to the experiment.

31
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,500
Now, if this is your first go around,

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,260
you may also want to try cross checking
your results with other methods.

33
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:26,840
For example,

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,780
you could use the non parametric sign
tests that we talked about earlier.

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,590
To compare the results to what you got
from your parametric hypothesis test.

36
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,540
>> Sounds good.

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,910
Now let's go over some examples
