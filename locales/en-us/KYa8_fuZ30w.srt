1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,620
Now, consider the following
hypothetical AB tests.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,227
If you where planning to run each of
these tests, which cases are the most

3
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:10,446
ethically concerning according
to the criteria just outlined?

4
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:14,907
In each case, check the box if you would
seek further review or possibly obtain

5
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:18,865
user consent, rather than moving
forward without further review.

6
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:19,720
And first,

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,420
suppose you want a news website with
articles that give financial advice

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,000
such as whether to invest in index
funds or pick individual stocks.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,030
You want users to take a survey and

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,540
answer which of five broad
ranges includes their net worth.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,310
You want to test various methods of
getting users to take the survey.

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,830
One method is an option to take
the survey at the bottom of the article.

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,340
And another is to prompt the user to
take the survey after reading the first

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,650
page, and not allow them to continue to
the second page until they've responded.

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,240
Would you seek out further review or
move forward with this experiment?

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,360
Next, suppose you work at
a company that delivers meals and

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,980
you want to test different
layouts of the menu to see

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,120
if users order food more often
with particular layouts.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,300
Would you seek out review in this case?

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,940
Finally, suppose your company builds
devices that measure heart rate and

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,750
an app that allows users to track their
heart rate during various activities.

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,650
You want to test whether different
ways of presenting the heart rate

23
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,740
data leads users to increase
how much they exercise.

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,950
Again, check the box if you would
seek further ethical review of

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,680
this experiment.
