1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,870
Sensitivity can be a bit
tricky to calculate, so

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,960
people have a few different techniques
they might use to determine how many

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,320
page views they'll need.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,510
First, some programming languages
have built-in libraries that can

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,760
calculate this.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,410
You might also be able to find a table
where you can look up the answer, or

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,450
you might be able to use
an online calculator.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,410
For the audacity experiment,
we'd like you to use the online

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,910
calculator linked in
the instructors notes.

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,800
Now on this calculator,

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,010
there are a few different pieces of
information you'll have to enter.

12
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,500
The baseline conversion rate in our
case means the estimated click through

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,580
probability before making the change,
and the minimum detectable effect is

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,240
what we've been calling
the practical significance level.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,100
You'll also need to specify whether
your practical significance

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,730
total is an absolute or
a relative change.

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,560
We've been using an absolute change,
so make sure you check this option.

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,520
We'll talk more about
the difference in Lesson three.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,432
Finally, you'll need to enter
1 minus beta and alpha.

20
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:56,441
Note that this calculator refers to
1 minus beta as statistical power,

21
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,550
rather than sensitivity.

22
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,720
Write the number of page views we'll
need in each group of the experiment

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,050
in this box.

24
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,709
Recall that before making the change,

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:10,240
we collected 1000 unique page views,
of which 100 resulted in a click,

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,850
We decided on a practical
significance level of 2%, or 0.02,

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,710
which I am calling d min, because it's
the minimum difference we care about.

28
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,710
And you should use alpha equals 0.05,
and

29
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,040
beta equals 0.2,
which is fairly standard.
