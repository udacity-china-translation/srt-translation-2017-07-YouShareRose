00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,940
Okay.
In the lessons up to now,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,340
you've figured out what metrics
to use to evaluate your change.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,970
You've characterized those metrics,
you've designed and

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,380
at least preliminarily
sized your experiment.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,820
Now that you've run your experiment,

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,900
something we're not really
covering the mechanics of here,

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,530
you want to see what you can conclude
from the data that you've captured.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,450
In this lesson, we'll go over how
to analyze the results from your

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,430
experiment, and determine what you
can and what you cannot conclude.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,050
We'll start with the sanity checks we've
discussed before, and then look at how

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,910
to handle evaluation, whether you
have a single or multiple metrics.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,450
Finally, we'll talk
about analysis gotchas.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,440
As always, remember that running
A/B tests is an iterative process.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,700
What you'll learn from this lesson may
inform the steps that you've done up

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,400
to now in designing your test as well.
