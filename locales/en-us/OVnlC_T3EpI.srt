1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,310
Diane, I've got data from my experiment.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,660
Can we look at
the click-through rate and

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,540
see whether the change
was an improvement?

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,140
>> Hold your horsies, there!

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,230
Not quite yet.

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,150
Before we can look at click-through
rates to determine what happened in your

7
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,290
experiment, first we have to do all
those sanity checks in order to

8
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,965
ensure that your experiment
was run properly.

9
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:19,140
>> Hm, what kind of sanity checks?

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,400
>> Well, there are all sorts
of things that can go wonky,

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,530
that could really
invalidate your results.

12
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,320
For example, maybe something went
wrong in the experiment diversion and

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,060
now your experiment and
your control aren't comparable.

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,420
Or maybe you used some filters and

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,440
you set up the filter differently
in the experiment and the control.

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,560
Or you set up data capture and
your data capture isn't

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,730
actually capturing the events that you
want to look for in your experiment.

18
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,970
Or you know I could just
kind of keep going.

19
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,065
Remember in lesson three when
we talked about counting clicks?

20
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:48,682
Well all those ways that
counting clicks can go wrong?

21
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,364
We have to test for

22
00:00:49,364 --> 00:00:52,480
all of those before you can look
at the results of your experiment.

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,660
>> Okay, how do I test for those things?

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,400
>> So do you remember
back in lessons three and

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,190
lessons four when we talked
about invariant metrics?

26
00:00:59,190 --> 00:00:59,900
You're going to check those.

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,510
And there are really two
main types of checks.

28
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,430
The first one is going to be
the population sizing metrics,

29
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,890
based on your unit of diversion.

30
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,010
Now what you're really checking there
is that your experiment population and

31
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,660
your control populations
are actually comparable.

32
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,070
The other check are those
actual invariants,

33
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,020
those metrics that shouldn't change
when you run your experiment.

34
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,350
And what you want to do is you want
to test that they didn't change.

35
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,300
Now, once you've done those sanity
checks, then, and only then,

36
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,610
should you be doing the more
complicated analysis to determine, hey,

37
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,770
was my experiment good, was it bad,
what's my recommendation going to be?
