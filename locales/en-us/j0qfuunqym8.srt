1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,100
Now I want you to assess the participant
risk of a few possible experiments.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,640
For each experiment, choose whether
you think the risk is minimal or

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,010
more than minimal.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,310
That is beyond the risks that may
be encountered in normal life.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,340
First, suppose you were on
a search engine such as Bing and

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,560
you're testing a change adding
information to your results page.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,480
Specifically for shopping queries,

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,950
you're adding price information
available from product sites.

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,720
How much risk would this cause
the users of your website?

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,380
Second, suppose you've created an app
that helps users monitor their diet,

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,790
exercise, and sleep.

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,100
you're considering adding a feature
that gives users dietary advice and

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,240
lets them know the possible
consequences of their current diets.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,250
For example, your app might let
a user know that their current sugar

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,440
intake puts them at high risk for
developing diabetes, and

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,170
advise that they eat less sugar.

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,580
Would it pose beyond a minimal
risk to test this change?

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,880
Finally, suppose you run an online
encyclopedia, such as Wikipedia, and

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,870
you want to test changing
the location of the search bar.

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,800
What level of risk would this present?

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,750
For each change, check the box if you
think testing the change would pose more

22
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,940
than a minimal risk to
the website's users.
