00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,620
Can you summarize what we've
learned about variability?

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,520
>> So what we've learned so

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,050
far is that different metrics
have different variability.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,770
And in fact, the variability may be so
high for a metric,

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,730
that's actually not practical to use
in volume in your, your experiment,

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,840
even if the metric makes a lot
of business or product sense.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,100
Now, what we've also learned is
that to really be able to compute

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,650
the variability, we need to understand
the distribution of the underlying data.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,300
And we looked at both analytical
techniques as well as

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,420
empirical techniques for
computing that variability.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, hopefully what you've
learned overall is that

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,940
computing the variability of
a metric is actually really tricky.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,460
And so you want to be taking a lot of
care, and you want to be ensuring that

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,810
not just any random engineer or
product manager is going through and

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,390
computing the variability,
especially of complicated metrics
