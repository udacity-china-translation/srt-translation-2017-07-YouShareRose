00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,660
Like Diane said, before you run your
experiment you'll need to decide how

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,060
many page views you plan to collect
before you make your conclusion.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,900
First let's look at how the distribution
changes when you increase

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,190
the sample size.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,040
This is what the distribution of results
would look like if you collected

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,200
a thousand samples and there was no
true difference between the two groups.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,950
That's why the mean is zero.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,398
You'll reject the null and conclude
that there was a difference if you

9
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,260
measure a value less than this one
roughly, or greater than this one.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,560
So you're probability of falsely
concluding there was a difference,

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,076
which is often called alpha, is 0.05.

12
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:38,810
If you increase your number of samples,
say to 5,000, then the standard error

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,700
will decrease, so the distribution
of results will look much narrower.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,270
To keep alpha the same,
that means the cut-offs for

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,310
rejecting the null
will be closer to zero.

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,890
Now let's say you decided to
only collect 1,000 page views so

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,330
that you could make
a conclusion more quickly.

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,910
Recall that this is the distribution of
results if there is no true difference,

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,332
and as we saw, alpha will be 0.05.

20
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:02,700
Now let's consider the case
where there is a difference.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,900
Specifically, the difference is
equal to the practical significance

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,960
level of 0.02.

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,590
You'll fail to reject the null, and

24
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,180
conclude there was not a significant
difference in the same cases.

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,100
Now, the probability of
failing to reject the null

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,480
when the null was in fact false, which
is often called Beta, is pretty high.

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,050
Even if there is a true difference,

28
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,830
it's pretty likely that
you'll be inside this range.

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,210
So by collecting a small sample,
alpha is low,

30
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,410
that is, you're unlikely
to launch a bad experiment.

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,030
But beta is high, that is, you're likely
to fail to launch an experiment that

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,520
actually did have
a difference you care about.

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,850
Now beta, or the probability of
falsely failing to draw a conclusion,

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,010
depends on how big
your effect really was.

35
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,360
For well behaved distributions
like the normal distribution,

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,950
as your true change gets larger and
larger, then beta will go down.

37
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,870
So you typically consider beta at
your practical significance boundary

38
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,600
since you don't care about
any smaller changes, and

39
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,720
any larger changes will have a lower
beta, that is, a lower chance of error.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,080
People also refer to one minus beta
as the sensitivity of the experiment.

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,600
In general, you want your experiment
to have a high level of sensitivity at

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,660
the practical significance boundary.

43
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,310
People often choose 80%.

44
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,490
Now again, let's look at what happens
if you collect 5,000 samples.

45
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,830
Both distributions get tighter.

46
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,250
And as before, alpha doesn't change.

47
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,800
However, in the case where
there is a true difference,

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,240
you're much less likely to fall within
the range of failing to reject the null.

49
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,760
That is, you're more likely
to reject the null and

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,730
conclude there was a difference.

51
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,990
So beta has gone down and
your power has increased.
