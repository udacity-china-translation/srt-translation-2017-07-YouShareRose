1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,200
You said consistency was the first
of three main considerations.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,180
What's the second?

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,840
>> The second is ethical considerations.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,870
Do you remember back in lesson two,
when we went through the principles and

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,480
questions that you should keep
in mind as you're designing,

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,340
running and analyzing your experiment?

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,093
Well, one of those principles and
questions was regarding what data you're

8
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:19,872
collecting, and
whether the data is identified or not.

9
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:24,758
If you are using a User ID then by
definition the data is identified.

10
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:29,114
And so you have all of those security
and confidentiality questions that you

11
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:33,580
have to really answer if you're
going to gather data by User ID.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,430
Now if your internal processes
are really good you are going to be good

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,590
tackling that challenge.

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,420
But if not you are,

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,490
you want to think through whether you
want to go through all of that work.

16
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,761
Now, the other issue that comes
up with the choice of unit and

17
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:49,670
of diversion is that
of informed consent.

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,520
If you're using the User ID,
you know who the user is, and

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,890
you can plausibly get user consent.

20
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,540
If you're doing a vent based or

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,490
a cookie based diversion,
you don't really know who the user is.

22
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,980
It's not really a, necessarily,
a consistent experience.

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,349
And so user consent becomes
a little bit less of an issue.
