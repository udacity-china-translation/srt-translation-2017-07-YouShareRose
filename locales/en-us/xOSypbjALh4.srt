1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,521
Now, I'll step through an example
of turning a high-level metric into

2
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:05,480
a well-defined metric.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,110
In lesson one,

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,800
we have chosen the high-level
metric click-through probability.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,410
And we defined this as the number of
unique users who clicked the button

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,050
divided by the number of unique
users who visited the home page.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,260
Now, this is actually not
a completely specified metric yet.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,980
And there are also some
other possible definitions.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,490
First, to use this definition,

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,190
we need some way of determining whether
two events are from the same user.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,140
Let's say we use cookies.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,550
Next, if the same user or
cookie visits the page once and

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,700
then comes back a week or two later, do
we really only want to count that once?

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,920
Usually, you'll want to count
those visits separately,

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,930
which means that you'll also
need to choose a time period.

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,660
Do you only count one page view per
user each minute, hour, day, or what?

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,200
So one fully specified definition
would be that for each minute,

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,830
you take the number of cookies that
clicked during that minute divided by

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,690
the number of cookies that interacted
with the page at all during that minute.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,090
Now, this definition actually leads
to a whole family of definitions

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,840
since you could choose
any time interval here.

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,370
Changing this time interval could
give you a different answer.

23
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,860
For example, suppose your site only has
one user who visits the site and clicks.

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,500
Then 5 minutes later,
they reload the page but don't click.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,980
30 seconds after that, they reload
again and do click this time.

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,700
And then 12 hours later, they reload
the page one last time and don't click.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,560
Assume that this user keeps the same
cookie throughout this process.

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,410
Now, if you group cookies by minute,

29
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,450
there are three separate groups where
these two events are in the same group

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,220
since they happened within
a minute of each other.

31
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,742
Since two of these groups resulted
in a click, and the third did not,

32
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:50,070
the per-minute click-through
probability is two-thirds.

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,830
Similarly, if you group by hour,
there are two groups,

34
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,699
one of which had a click, so
the probability is one-half.

35
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,570
And if you group by day,
everything goes in the same group and

36
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,570
the probability is one.

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,900
An alternative definition would be to
remove the idea of a unique user and

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,840
instead to create a unique ID for
each page view.

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,540
And then when a user clicks,

40
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,160
record the idea of
the corresponding parent page view.

41
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,610
Then you could define the click-through
probability as the number of page views

42
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,190
that eventually result in a click
divided by the number of page views.

43
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,390
This data capture is usually
easier than recording cookies and

44
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,720
then later grouping by cookie.

45
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,670
Now, this definition also
needs a time interval.

46
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,200
How long do you want to wait
after each page view to see if it

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,090
resulted in a click?

48
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,104
Once you pick a time interval,

49
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:42,081
you would count how many page views
had a click within the specified time.

50
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:45,717
One way these two definitions could
give different results is if the user

51
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:48,228
refreshes the page within
the given time period.

52
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:52,066
For example, suppose the user
visits the page without clicking.

53
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,173
Then 30 seconds later,

54
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,360
they refreshed the page which
generates another page view.

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,740
Finally, 1 second after
the second page view, they click.

56
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,190
Then, using definition one with
a time interval of one minute so

57
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,870
that all these events are grouped
together, there would be 1 cookie that

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,460
clicked divided by 1 total cookie for
a probability of 1.

59
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,040
But for definition two with the same
time interval, only 1 page view resulted

60
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,470
in a click over 2 total page views,
so the probability would be one-half.

61
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,950
Finally, an even simpler definition
would be to count the total number of

62
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,390
clicks and divide by the total
number of page views.

63
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,522
As you know, this would really
be a click-through rate,

64
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:33,100
rather than a click-through probability.

65
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,650
Which definition you use
will depend on your product.

66
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,750
Often, definitions one and
two will be almost

67
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,700
indistinguishable if you choose the same
relatively short time interval.

68
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,590
So you might want to go with definition
two, since it's easier to compute.

69
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,240
Now, for each of the three
definitions we just discussed,

70
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,870
the cookie-based probability,
the page view-based probability, and

71
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,470
the rate, consider whether it would be
affected by the following problems.

72
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,260
You can find the complete
definitions for

73
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,020
these metrics in the instructor's notes.

74
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,402
First, suppose you want your metric
to be unaffected by the user double

75
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:06,160
clicking.

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,790
That is, you want your metric
to have the same value of

77
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,630
the user double clicks
as if they single click.

78
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,661
Which of these metric definitions
would work for this purpose?

79
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:19,432
And second, when the user clicks the
Back button, the browser may have cached

80
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:23,055
the page, so another page view may or
may not be generated.

81
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,621
Which if these metrics would have
the same value regardless of whether

82
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:30,197
a second page view is generated when
the user presses the Back button?

83
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:33,666
Third, suppose you were worried that
JavaScript may not be tracking clicks

84
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,055
correctly.

85
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:38,935
For example, it might send
two clicks instead of one, or

86
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:40,435
it might fail to record a click at all.

87
00:04:41,535 --> 00:04:44,385
Which metrics would have the same
value regardless of whether

88
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,675
problems such as this occurred?

89
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:49,565
In each case, check the box for
any metric that

90
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:53,225
would give the same value regardless
of whether the problem occurred.

91
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:56,485
In each case, assume that all the
relevant events occurs within the time

92
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:59,000
interval for the probability metrics.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,090
So for example, if the time interval for
the probabilities were five minutes,

94
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,570
assume that a double click
happens within five minutes.
