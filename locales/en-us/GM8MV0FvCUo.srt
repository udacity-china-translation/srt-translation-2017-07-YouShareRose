00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,780
Diane, what should you do if one of
the last three cases comes up, but

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,420
you don't have time to
run a new experiment?

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,300
>> Wouldn't life be easy if we
only had the first three cases?

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,010
The problem is that despite
our best intentions and

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,540
efforts to power our
experiments properly,

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,150
you're going to get situations
where the data's uncertain.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,550
What you have to do is to communicate to
the decision-makers when they're going

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,850
to have to make a judgement, and take
a risk, because the data is uncertain.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,270
They're going to have to use other
factors, like strategic business issues,

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,460
or other factors besides the data.
