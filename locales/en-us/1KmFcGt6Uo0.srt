1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,260
Okay, what's the next thing we need
to characterize about our metrics in

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,170
order to analyze the experiment?

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,170
>> Well, the next thing we need
to talk about is variability.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,110
Up until now, we've talked sort of about
developing intuition for the metric,

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,330
about sensitivity, and robustness.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,080
But now, we're going to need
a really more rigorous statistical

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,070
definition of variability, so that we
can use it in lesson four to look at

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,110
sizing the experiment, and in lesson
five to actually analyze the confidence

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,858
intervals, and draw conclusions.

10
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:30,796
We also want to check that the practical
significance level we're interested in,

11
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:32,549
is really realistic for our metric.

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,160
If we have a metric that varies a lot
under normal circumstances, that may not

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,750
really work for us in practice,
because the practical significance level

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,130
we're interested in, just may not
be feasible with this metric.

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,460
>> Okay, so,
how would we figure that out?

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,190
>> Well,
in lesson one we did a simple example

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,340
of our click-through probability,
where we looked at user data which was

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,090
whether the user clicked
on a specific link or not.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,870
And our summary statistic was
the overall click-through probability.

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,270
In that case, we were able to
do an analytic, or a theoretical

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,810
computation of the variance that we
expected from our overall probability.

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,650
Now, for other types of metrics,
the same thing works.

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,590
For example,
if you have nice normal data,

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,230
like demographic data, you have counts
or probabilities, then usually,

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,450
you can do the,
the confidence interval, theoretically.

26
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,260
But in some other cases, you may
actually have to do this another way.

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,920
So, if you're using something
like a count or a probability,

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,250
then you're only really dealing with the
variability of a single measurement, or

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,060
of a constrained one,
in the case of probability.

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,330
If you move on to using ratios or
percentiles, like the 90th percentile,

31
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,295
or if your data, like our latency data,
is pretty lumpy,

32
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:46,430
then you probably want to actually
compute the variability empirically,

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,360
which we'll talk about a bit more in,
in a moment.
