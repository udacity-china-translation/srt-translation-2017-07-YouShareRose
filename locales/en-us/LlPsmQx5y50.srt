1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,760
The answer in the first case depends
primarily on what information is being

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,060
gathered in the survey.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,430
If the survey collects personal
information such as names,

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,470
then the information received
in the survey is more sensitive.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,810
However, in most cases,

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,920
this survey should be fine to run if
no personal information is collected.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,550
Survey data that doesn't
collect personal information

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,600
isn't usually considered sensitive.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,560
Since users can chose to respond
either not at all or dishonestly.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,880
Users can voluntarily
choose what to do and

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,900
its this implicit voluntary
consent that's key.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,940
The ethical considerations also increase
if the user can only read the article in

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,540
exchange for

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,610
their survey information, even if
there is still that voluntary consent.

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,420
The mail delivery experiment
is probably fine.

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,970
No new sensitive data
is being collected, and

17
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,010
the risk to users of different
menu layouts is minimal.

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,200
The heart rate experiment should
probably get additional review.

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,470
Since physical fitness is
important to good health,

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,190
presentations that confuse
users about their data or

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,650
encourage them to exercise too much or
too little could pose a serious risk.

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,740
Also, the data being collected
is certainly sensitive and

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,480
needs to be carefully secured and
anonymized.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Depending on the data, it may not be
possible to anonymize it while keeping

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,590
the same level of granularity in which
case you may need to aggregate the data.
