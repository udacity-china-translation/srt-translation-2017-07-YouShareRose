1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,280
Now let's look at some different cases
that could have come up in our results.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,970
Here I've drawn our practical
significance boundary as these

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,000
two blue lines, and
zero as this black line.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,130
Our point estimate, that is d hat,
for the example we just went over was

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,680
greater than the practical
significance boundary.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,250
And in fact, both ends of the confidence
interval were greater than

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,120
the practical significance boundary.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,660
Based on this, it's highly probable
that the click-through probability did,

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,090
in fact, change by more than
the practical significance level.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,400
Now let's go through some other possible
cases of what your results could look

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,670
like, and practice recommending
a decision in each case.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,630
Choose whether you would want to launch
the change, not launch the change, or

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,040
try to gather more data,

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,100
ideally by running an additional test,
in each of these cases.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,010
The first case is the one you just saw,
and as I said,

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,800
I would launch this change.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,700
You should assume that a positive
change in click-through probability

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,330
is desirable, and
a negative change is undesirable.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,440
Remember that the goal of running
A/B tests is to gather data to

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,930
make a decision.

21
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,850
And the reason we did the work of
computing the power in the confidence

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,760
intervals is so that we would
understand how likely it is that our

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,530
results are repeatable and robust.

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,990
And make the right decision.

25
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,650
Given this, choose the decision
you think is best for each case.
