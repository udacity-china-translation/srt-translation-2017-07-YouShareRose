1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,640
Now lets talk about how to
measure the sensitivity and

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,790
robustness of some different metrics.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,760
Specifically, we'll try to
choose a summary metric for

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,060
the latency of a video, that is how
long it takes the video to load.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,710
Like before, there are various
different summary metrics we could use,

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,310
median, 90th percentile,
99th percentile.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,940
So, we'll want to look at
the sensitivity and robustness for

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,970
each of those summary metrics.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,340
Like Carrie mentioned, we could start
out by either looking at the results of

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,830
a bunch of experiments or
by doing a retrospective analysis.

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,320
Let's do the retrospective
analysis first.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,560
What we might do is de-segment
the data by different videos.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,880
In other words, look at the distribution
of load times per video.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,650
If we wanted to look at
the distribution of a single video,

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,870
we could plot it as
a histogram like this, but

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,790
this can get hard to see when we have
multiple different videos to compare.

17
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,080
Instead, we could draw something called
a density line over the histogram

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,710
that roughly approximates
the shape of the histogram.

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,070
Then we could plot only
this density line for

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,010
several different videos to compare.

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,290
If I do that, I get something like this.

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,440
Suppose here that I've picked five
roughly comparable videos of the same

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,430
size, so I get a roughly similar
distribution of load times for

24
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,890
the different videos.

25
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,190
You can see two peaks here,
a fairly long load time, and

26
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,380
then more people with
a shorter load time.

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,530
This could happen if you had people
with different types of Internet access,

28
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,230
a slower Internet access and
a faster one.

29
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,360
Now, in order to characterize
the sensitivity and

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,120
robustness of different summary metrics,
I can see how they vary across videos.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,790
So, here I've plotted a few
different summary metrics by video.

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,880
The median, 80th, 85th,
90th, and 99th percentile.

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,740
In theory, since these videos
are all comparable, there should

34
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,470
not be too much difference between
the different videos for a good metric.

35
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,690
Here, you can see that the median,
the 80th and

36
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,810
the 85th percentile don't
move around too much.

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,900
They're pretty good.

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,850
But the 90th and the 99th percentile
are zigzagging around a bit.

39
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,280
This is a good indication that the 90th
and 99th percentile are not robust

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,880
enough as summary metrics,
since they're moving around quite a bit,

41
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,660
even for
videos that are pretty comparable.

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,880
Of course, you have to be careful.

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,590
Maybe these metrics
are moving around for

44
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,050
some other reason because the videos
aren't actually comparable.

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,830
For example, maybe the videos
are at different resolutions or

46
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,050
have a different encoding scheme.

47
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,620
In this case,

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,570
let's say that we're pretty sure
that these videos are comparable and

49
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,930
that we've checked for
those things, but in general,

50
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,260
if you think your metric
might be too sensitive or

51
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,050
equivalently not robust enough,
then it's a good idea to dig and ensure

52
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,900
that there's not some underlying factor
that you haven't taken into account.

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,580
Now, the other technique Carrie
mentioned is to look at actual

54
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,540
experiments, preferably experiments
you've already run to save yourself some

55
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,360
effort, but
you can also run new experiments.

56
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,600
So, for this example, for the load time,

57
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,810
it would be great if we had experiments
that changed the resolution.

58
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,310
That should impact the latency,
and if it doesn't,

59
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,700
then our metric isn't sensitive enough.

60
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,590
So let's take a look at data from five
different experimental groups that

61
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,630
have a range of resolutions.

62
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,790
Here, video one has
the highest resolution,

63
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,720
which means that it should
have the highest load time.

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,190
And in fact, you do see that video
one is off to the right a bit more.

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,230
You can also see that the people
who already have the slow Internet

66
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,050
connection are a lot more affected by
the resolution than the people with

67
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,820
the faster connection type.

68
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,730
Now let's also look at the same summary
metrics for these experimental videos.

69
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,710
What we should see is the latency going
down as we increase the video number,

70
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,950
that is, we have a lower resolution.

71
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,550
And in fact, for some of these metrics
we do see that, but for the median and

72
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,770
the 80th percentile,
they don't really seem to be moving.

73
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,840
This is a good indication
that the median and

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,015
the 80th percentile
are not sensitive enough.

75
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:42,560
They're not showing a change when we
do make a change that we care about.

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,630
So in this case, the 85th
percentile might be a good choice

77
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,790
of a metric that's both robust and
sensitive.
