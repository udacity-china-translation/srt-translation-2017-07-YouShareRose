1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,920
I would expect the new measurement
to be relatively close to 100.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,647
I would be very surprised
if the result were 900, and

3
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:11,313
I'd actually also be pretty
surprised about 150.

4
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:15,700
110 or 101 would both be in
line with what I expected.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,900
Later, we'll talk about
the standard error of your sample,

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,230
which describes precisely how
variable the estimate will be

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,140
if you take different
samples with the same size.
