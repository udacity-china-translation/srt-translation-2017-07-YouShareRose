1
00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:03,388
Here's how I would figure out whether
this division of cookies is within

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:04,190
what I expected.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,610
I have a random event with
exactly two outcomes.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,155
A cookie gets assigned to either
the control or the experiment group.

5
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,328
I can think of this as like
flipping a fair coin and

6
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:15,458
if the coin comes up heads, I'll put
the cookie in the control group.

7
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:20,362
Then I want to know if it's surprising
that the coin came up heads 64,454

8
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:20,892
times.

9
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:22,323
Does that sound familiar?

10
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:25,403
The number of heads will follow
the binomial distribution, so

11
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:28,728
I can construct a binomial confidence
interval like in lesson one.

12
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,428
The total sample size
here is about 120,000,

13
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:34,548
which is definitely enough to
assume a normal distribution.

14
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:35,943
So here are the steps I'll take.

15
00:00:35,943 --> 00:00:39,601
First, I'll compute the standard
deviation of a binomial distribution

16
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,489
with probability 0.5 of success,

17
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,445
which I'll define as being
assigned to the control group.

18
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,436
Then I'll multiply the standard
deviation by the z-score

19
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:49,945
of my confidence level to
get the margin of error,

20
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:52,903
then I'll compute a confidence
interval around 0.5.

21
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:54,888
If the experiment is setup properly,

22
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,112
it's very likely that thee
observed fraction of successes or

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,971
cookies in the control group will
fall within this confidence interval.

24
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:05,322
And finally, I'll compute thee
observed fraction of successes or

25
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:06,910
cookies in the control group and

26
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,510
I'll check whether this value falls
with in this confidence interval.

27
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,624
This is a little different then thee
approach in lesson one, where we

28
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:17,558
computed the confidence interval around
the observed click-through probability.

29
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:20,128
In that case, we didn't know
the true click-through probability.

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,411
But here, I know that if
the experiment is set up properly,

31
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:25,260
the true probability is 0.5.

32
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,573
So, I can compute that
confidence interval.

33
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:29,174
The results are the same though.

34
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:31,101
Now, I'll go through these steps for
this data.

35
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:34,698
The standard deviation comes to 0.0014.

36
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:39,898
I'll use a 95% confidence level
as usual, so the z-score is 1.96.

37
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:43,315
So the margin of error comes to 0.0027.

38
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:49,438
That means that the confidence
interval goes from 0.4973 to 0.5027.

39
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:50,819
So 95% of the time,

40
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,833
the observed fraction of cookies
should fall within this range.

41
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,264
In fact, the fraction of
cookies in the control group,

42
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:00,462
which I'll p hat is 0.5104.

43
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:03,848
Now this is significantly
greater than 0.5027, so

44
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:06,345
something about this setup is incorrect.

45
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:08,570
To get a better idea of
what could be going wrong,

46
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,973
it's a good idea to look at
the day by day data again.

47
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:14,258
One good thing to check is whether
any particular day stands out as

48
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:17,552
causing the problem or whether it
seems to be an overall pattern.

49
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:21,188
First, I'll look at which specific days
had more cookies in the control group.

50
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:24,771
It turns out that in 11 out of 14 days,
there were more cookies in the control

51
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:27,028
group than the experiment,
which is quite high.

52
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:30,969
I'll also compute the fraction of the
cookies that were in the control group

53
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,938
each day, there were a few
days with 0.53 or higher.

54
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:36,542
And no day obviously
stands out as the highest.

55
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:40,622
This points to an overall problem rather
than a problem on a specific day.

56
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:43,295
At this point, it's a good idea
to talk to the engineers and

57
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:46,085
figure out if something was
wrong with the experiment setup.

58
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:48,191
If that doesn't work,
you could try slicing.

59
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,064
For example, by country, language or

60
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:53,812
platform to see if one particular slice
looks like it's causing the problem or

61
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:56,335
you could check the age of
the cookies in each group.

62
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:59,745
Does one group tend to have more new
cookies while the other group has older

63
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:01,293
cookies or something like that.

64
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:04,253
Now suppose you run another experiment,
this time for

65
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,448
seven days with event based diversion.

66
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:09,303
This table shows the number of
pageviews in the control and

67
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:10,768
experiment groups each day.

68
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:12,881
The total number of
events in the control and

69
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,776
experiment groups are these numbers.

70
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:19,041
Calculate a 95% confidence interval for
the fraction of total pageviews in

71
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:23,185
the control group and put your bounds
in these boxes to four decimal places.

72
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:26,151
The center of your confidence
interval should be 0.5,

73
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:29,965
then calculate the observed fraction
of pageviews in the control group and

74
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:31,493
write the answer in this box.

75
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:33,395
Also, to four decimal places.

76
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:35,396
Does this distribution
between the control and

77
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:37,202
experiment group pass your sanity check?

78
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:38,300
Select yes or no.
