1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,600
I'll show you using Google Spreadsheets
to perform the calculations.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,970
First, I'll make a new
column with the differences.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,048
So I'll take equals,

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:13,080
then first group minus the second
group and I'll drag that down.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,630
Next I'll calculate the standard
deviation of the differences,

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,860
which comes to about 0.0364.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,780
I'll also calculate the average
which comes to about 0.0043.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,180
So the center of the first
confidence interval is 0.0043.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,776
And the margin of error
is 0.0364 times 1.96.

10
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:37,036
That is the standard deviation I just
calculated, times the z score for

11
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,746
a 95% confidence level.

12
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:41,410
That comes to 0.0713.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,896
Then the upper bound of the confidence
interval will be 0.0756 and

14
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:48,943
the lower bound will be negative 0.0670.

15
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:51,740
To get the empirical
confidence interval,

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,570
I'll sort the rows by difference,
which is in column D.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,580
Then the bounds of the confidence
interval will go from

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,130
the second smallest value
to the second largest.

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:06,017
That means the balance of the empirical
confidence interval are negative 0.06,

20
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:07,149
and 0.08.

21
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:09,870
The two confidence intervals
are in the same ballpark but

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,490
they're not super close.

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,840
That's because for the empirical
confidence interval in particular, it's

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,200
best to have more than 40 experiments
to be really confident in your answer.
