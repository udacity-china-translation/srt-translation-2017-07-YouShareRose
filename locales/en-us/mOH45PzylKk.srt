1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,250
And for the updated course description,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,920
the primary metric I would want to
track is the probability progressing

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,460
from the course list page to the course
overview page for that course.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,060
That's metric 3 on our list over here.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,710
It would also be good to track
continued progression down the funnel.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,840
If the updated description
was accidentally misleading,

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,810
you might see an increased click through
rate to the course overview page, but

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,480
then a drop off when students realized
the course wasn't right for them.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,330
So it might be good to track the
probability of enrolling in the course,

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,580
and if you have time,

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,490
maybe even how students
are progressing through the course.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,050
Now by increasing the size of the Start
Now button, you're making the button

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,340
more prominent, presumably with the
intention of making it easier to find.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,290
So this is a good time to use
the click-through-rate of the button,

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,265
which is metric 1 on our list.

16
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:51,360
Click-through-probability could
also be a good choice here, but

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,830
like Diane mentioned in lesson one,
rates are usually better for

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,180
assessing how easy it
is to find a button.

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,950
For the experiment making the benefits
of the paid service more clear, the best

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,569
metric to use is the probability that
the enrolled students start paying for

21
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,980
coaching, or metric 5.

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,650
It would also be good to measure
the user retention over various

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,430
time periods.

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,850
That is, how long do the students
continue paying for coaching?

25
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,180
Or you might also look
at some usage metrics.

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,110
That is, among the students
who are using the coaching,

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,390
do they use the coaching more, now that
it's more clear what the coaches can do?
