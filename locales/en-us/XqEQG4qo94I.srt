1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,550
Now consider invariant metrics for
another experiment.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,240
This time, Audacity changes the location
of the sign in button to see if they can

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,060
get users to sign in sooner.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,130
The sign in button currently appears
on the course list page, and if a user

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,610
who isn't signed in tries to enroll in
a course, they are prompted to sign in.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,610
But in the experiment group, the sign
in button is added to every page,

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,260
including the home page.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,915
The unit of diversion is a cookie,
since Audacity wants

9
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:28,500
a consistent experience across
the sign-in sign-out boundary.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,340
Again, which metrics would
make good invariants?

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,840
Number of events, click through rate or
CTR on the start now button,

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,580
the probability of a user
enrolls in a course.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,070
The sign in rate, that is,

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,310
the rate at which users who are not
signed in, complete the sign in process.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,740
Or finally,
the average load time of the video.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,960
Again, check each metric that would be
a good invariant for this experiment.
