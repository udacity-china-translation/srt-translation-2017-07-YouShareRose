1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,930
Okay, now we've estimated
the click-through probability of

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,420
the Start Now button, but we haven't
actually changed the button yet.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,310
Once we do that, and

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,420
we run the experiment,
how will we analyze the results?

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,430
>> Well, there's a concept in statistics
called hypothesis testing, or inference,

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,920
which is a quantitative way to establish

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,310
how likely it is that your
results occurred by chance.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,140
So, the first thing we need is what's
called a null hypothesis, or a baseline.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,420
In our case, that's the theory that
there's no difference in click-through

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,680
probability between our control,
and our experiment.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,810
Then we need to think about what's
called the alternative hypothesis.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,900
Are we interested in whether
the click-through rate is different?

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,730
Or just whether it's higher, or lower?

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,650
Or are we interested in any
kind of difference at all?
