1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,719
Okay, we've just seen some cases
where AB testing isn't very helpful.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,260
What should we do in those cases?

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,390
Are there any other
techniques you can use?

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,344
>> Well, there are a lot of different
ways to gather data about users.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,137
And, some of them can be
complimentary to running an AB

6
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:14,607
test eventually, as well.

7
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:19,200
So, for example, often you'll have logs
of what users did on your website.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,250
You can analyze them retrospectively, or
observationally, to see if a hypothesis

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,000
can be developed about what's
causing changes in their behavior.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,340
And, that's something where you may want
to go forward, and actually design, and

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,460
randomize, and experiment,
do a perspective analysis.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,930
And, you can use the two data sources
as, to kind of compliment each other.

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,830
Where, you may develop a hypothesis
from looking at the logs.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,060
But, you actually want to test out
whether you can make this happen in

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,220
an experiment.

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,600
And so then, you'll want to run an AB
test as well to compare the results,

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,740
and, and see if your theory is valid.

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,500
>> There's a whole host of other
techniques as well, ranging from user

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,540
experience research, to focus groups,
and surveys, and human evaluation.

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,620
Now, what happens is that AB
testing can give you a lot

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,040
of broad quantitative data.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,710
But, these other techniques
give you very deep and

23
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,010
qualitative data that are really
complementary to AB testing.

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,290
So, for example, you know, these other
techniques can do a better job of

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,220
telling you which mountain
you should be on.

26
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,960
So, we'll be going over some of these
other techniques in lesson three.

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,180
>> So, there are definitely some things
that are very difficult to test with

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,980
AB testing.

29
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,590
So, for example,
if you completely redo your site, or

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,950
change the way that
users interact with it.

31
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,770
>> That's something that can be really
hard to run a controlled experiment

32
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,160
with, and we'll talk about
why later in the course.
