00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,790
To give you a bit more variety
in the examples you've seen,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,420
I'm going to go over three
more possible changes.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,430
Again, for each one,

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,520
check the box if you think it would be
useful to run an A/B test on the change.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,300
First, suppose you have
a website selling cars, and

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,820
you're considering a change, and
you want to know wether that

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,570
change will make customers more likely
to return or refer their friends.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,220
Second, suppose a company
wants to update their brand,

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,080
including the main logo for their site.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,950
Would you A/B test this change?

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,970
Third, suppose you want to test some
changes to the initial page of your

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,590
mobile application.

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,150
You want to change things like
what information is included,

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,680
what wording you use,
and what colors you use.

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
Check each case that you think is
a good candidate for A/B testing.
