1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,201
The standard deviation in
this case comes to 0.0029.

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,315
And, that means the margin
of error is 0.0056.

3
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:13,774
The confidence interval balance
are then 0.4944 and 0.5056.

4
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:18,110
The actual fraction in
the control group is 0.5006.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,830
Which is within what is expected.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,090
So, this does pass the sanity check.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,882
Notice that the actual fraction in
the control group wasn't exactly 0.5.

8
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:29,890
And looking at the day by day data
again, the number of events in

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,225
the control and experiment groups
wasn't exactly equal on any day.

10
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:35,185
That's expected.

11
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,945
And, since the fraction in the control
group is within the bounds of

12
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:40,865
the confidence interval,
there's no reason to be alarmed.

13
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:44,525
Since the total numbers pass the sanity
check this time, there's no need to dig

14
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:46,985
into the day-by-day data to
figure out what's going wrong.
