1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,930
What do you do when the sign test and
the hypothesis test don't agree?

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,050
Or what if you have significant results
on weekends but not on weekdays?

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,700
>> Well, the first thing you want to
do as we talked about is take a really

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,120
critical look about how
your feature functions.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,420
Is it really operating differently for
different subgroups for

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,600
example on a particular platform.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,340
But there are real
statistical reasons that you

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,760
might get counter-intuitive results.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,850
One of them that shows off common lane
experiments is called Simpson's paradox.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,990
What it means is that there's a bunch
of different subgroups in your data

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,740
like user populations.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,320
And within each subgroup, the results
are stable but when you aggregate them

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,690
all together, it's the mix of subgroups
that actually drives your result.

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,920
>> That doesn't even sound possible.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,490
Can you give me an example?

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,890
>> So the example that most people
like was actually a real example about

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,950
graduate admissions at Berkeley.

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,530
So what was happening
is that in aggregate,

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,830
if you looked at the number of people
who are accepted divided by the number

20
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,080
that applied, the rate of women being
accepted was statistically significantly

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,770
lower than men being accepted,
which seemed bad.

22
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,190
But when you looked at it by department,
there were actually departments where

23
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,650
women were accepted at
a higher rate than men.

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,280
So how can that be?

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,850
The answer turned out to be that you had
to look at it by department, because

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,100
the acceptance rates by department were
variable, from 6% to as much as 60%.

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,250
And what was happening is that more
women were applying to the smaller

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,050
departments that had a very
low acceptance rate.

29
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,690
So when you aggregated the numbers,

30
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,410
ignoring department,
you saw women accepted at a lower rate.

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,010
But if you looked at each
department individually,

32
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,630
the rates were very comparable
between men and women.

33
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,855
>> Okay, and
how does this apply to our experiment?

34
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:44,015
>> Well, you can get this happening on
our experiment because you have these

35
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:46,590
subgroups like people who
use it more on weekdays or

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,720
people use it more on weekends.

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,450
And you may find that, for example,

38
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,870
new users are correlated with
weekend use and you know,

39
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,930
experienced users who react differently
are correlated with weekday use.

40
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,100
And so what sometimes you find in these
cases is that what drives the results of

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,850
your experiment are how many
people from each group you get.

42
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,080
Within each group,
their behavior is stable,

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
you can get a statistically significant
result or an insignificant result.

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,912
But when you add them all together,

45
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:17,940
all the changes in your traffic
mix are driving the results.

46
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,850
In a minute, Caroline's going to take
you through an example of how that

47
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,190
happens when you do
an experiment analysis.
