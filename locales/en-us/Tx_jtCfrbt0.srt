1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,340
Now lets take a look at a simplified
version of the Berkley paradox

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,300
with only two departments.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,890
As you can see more men applied to to
department A than department B and

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,410
vice versa for women.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,740
Now if I calculate the percentage of
men who were accepted to department

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,380
A I get 62% and if I do the same for
women, I get 82%.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,000
So acceptance is fairly high and
more women are accepted.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,890
Now if I do the same for

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,030
department B I get that the overall
acceptance rate is lower but

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,080
still more women were accepted than
men as a percentage of the applicants.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,590
However now let's look at the total
numbers of men and women who applied and

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,040
were accepted across both departments.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,230
Overall, a greater percentage of
men have been accepted than women.

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,490
How can this happen?

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,580
Like Kary said, the explanation is that
more women applied to department B,

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,920
which has a lower acceptance rate.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,300
So that a lower percentage of
women are accepted overall.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,020
Now the actual Berkeley data
was more complicated than this.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,120
There were more than two departments,
and

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,130
in some departments men had a higher
acceptance rate than women.

21
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,000
But not a statistically
significant difference, and

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,920
most departments had a small but
significant bias in favor of women.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,070
Now, how can this apply to AB testing?

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,080
Well, you could see the same sort of
think happen for click through rate.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,880
Where if you look at your total or
aggregate experiment results, then

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,562
the experiment group has a lower click
through rate than the control group.

27
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:21,680
But then if you break it
down by new users and

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,450
experienced users, you see the reverse.

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,500
How could this happen?

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,510
Actually, I want you to
fill in the numbers.

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,720
You should be able to use a similar
strategy to the Berkeley example.

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,360
Once you're done, you can take a minute
to think about what those results would

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,860
mean but
while you're coming up with the numbers

34
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,230
don't worry too much about
how plausible they are.

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,670
Fill in any numbers such that the click
through rate is higher in the experiment

36
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,120
group than the control group for
both new and experienced users.

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,750
But overall, the click through rate
is lower in the experiment group.

38
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,960
You only need to fill in these two
rows but if you also want to fill in

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,980
the total row to help keep track
of your work you can do that too.
