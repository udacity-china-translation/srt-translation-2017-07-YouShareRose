00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,960
In this lesson, we have gone over all
the necessary steps to choose metrics

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,250
for evaluating your experiment.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,510
First, we talked about establishing
the high level concept for your metrics.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,320
Next, we needed to go into
some nitty-gritty details

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,610
in order to actually
compute the metrics.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,700
Then we went over how to build
intuition about your metrics and

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,410
how appropriate they'll be for
different experiments.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,490
Finally, you learned how to characterize
the variability of your metrics.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,519
In the next lesson,

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,550
we'll dig into how to design an A/B
test using what you've learned.
