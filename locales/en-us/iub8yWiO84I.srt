1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,120
Because we have two samples,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,840
we'll need to choose a standard error
that gives us a good comparison of both.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,510
The simplest thing we can do is
calculate what is a called a pooled

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,790
standard error.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,440
Recall that we'll measure
the users who click in each group,

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,379
which we'll call x control and x
experiment, as well as the total number

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,510
of users in each group, which we'll
call n control and n experiment.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,430
Now, the first thing we'll calculate
will be what's called the pooled

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,040
probability of a click.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,010
And I'm using a hat here because
this is an estimated probability.

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,760
And the pooled probability is the total
probability of a click across

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,270
groups, that is,

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,247
the total number of users who clicked
divided by the total number of users.

14
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:41,250
Then we'll calculate the pooled standard
error, which is given by this formula.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,160
Now recall that we're going to estimate
the difference between p experiment and

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,950
p control, and I'll call this
difference d hat for difference.

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,840
Under the null hypothesis d,
the true difference is equal to zero.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,390
Then we would expect our estimation,
d hat, to be distributed normally,

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,990
with a mean of zero and a standard
deviation of the pooled standard error.

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,250
If the estimated d is greater than 1.96,
our z score,

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,220
times the pooled standard error, or
less than the negative of this cutoff,

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,220
then we can reject the null
hypothesis as unlikely and

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,390
say that our difference represents
a statistically significant difference.
