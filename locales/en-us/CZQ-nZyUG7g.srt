1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,830
Once I've figured out which metrics have
significant changes, what comes next?

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,371
>> Well, now you have to decide what
your results do and don't tell you.

3
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:10,008
If you have statistically
significant results,

4
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:14,980
then that means that you're unlikely to
have zero impact on the user experience.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,760
But now the questions come down to A,
do you understand the change?

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,135
And B, do you want to launch the change?

7
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:25,474
Okay, so what if I have a statistically
significant change in some metrics but

8
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:26,997
then in others, I don't.

9
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:30,710
Well, that goes back to A,
do you understand the change?

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,775
And having intuition and

11
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:35,150
experience with lots of other
experiments can really help here.

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,130
For example, maybe you know that for
small changes,

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,795
a change in one metric but no change all
the other metrics is perfectly fine.

14
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:45,245
But if you were to see those
same results for a big change,

15
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,075
that would probably indicate that
there's something going wrong.

16
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:50,085
>> Okay, and
the same question for slices.

17
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:53,585
What if your change has a positive
impact on one slice of your users, but

18
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:57,270
then, for another slice, there's no
impact or there's a negative impact?

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,194
>> Again, do you understand why?

20
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:02,046
Is it a question about
having different users, and

21
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,790
how much they like or
don't like the change?

22
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,380
Have you seen that effect
in other experiments?

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,680
Do you have a bug?

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,410
These are all possibilities
when you have changes

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,120
in one slice versus another.

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,340
Let me give you an example.

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,240
Bolding, right,

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,640
we like to basically bold certain
words in order to give them emphasis.

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,632
Now, bolding in like English or
German, or those types of alphabets,

30
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:25,104
works really well for
providing emphasis.

31
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:28,756
But if you try and bold in Japanese,
or Korean, or Chinese,

32
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,180
a bolded character is
actually really hard to read.

33
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,590
And it actually makes it harder for

34
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,050
a user to read the word
than if it was not bolded.

35
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,050
And so in that situation,

36
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,120
you may actually want to want
something different for that slice.

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,100
Maybe use a different color
as opposed to doing a bold.

38
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,980
>> That makes sense.

39
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,240
And then, bottom line, how do you decide
whether to launch your change or not?

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,680
>> You really have to ask
yourself a few questions.

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,427
One, do I have statistically
significant and

42
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:59,040
practically significant results
in order to justify the change?

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,666
The second question is, do I understand
what that change has actually done with

44
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,400
regards to user experience?

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,270
And the third one is, is it worth it?

46
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,050
Now the key thing to remember
is that the end goal is

47
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,460
actually making that recommendation
that shows your judgment.

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,870
It's not about designing
the experiment and running it and

49
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,245
sizing it properly, and having all
of the metric chosen correctly,

50
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:22,575
and all those different things.

51
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:26,059
Those are all signposts towards
your end goal of actually making

52
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:27,166
a recommendation.

53
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,089
And what's going to be remembered is,

54
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:32,715
did you recommend to launch it or
not and was it the right recommendation?
