1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,350
Okay, we know how to calculate pooled
standard error and confidence intervals.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,120
Are we ready to run the experiment?

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,500
>> Not quite.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,250
So, we first have to
design our experiment.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,840
Now, the main question
that we have to decide is

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,059
given that we have control over how
many page views go into our control and

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,940
our experiment, we have to decide
how many page views we need

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,020
in order to get a statistically
significant result.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,180
This is called statistical power.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,240
Now, the key thing is that if
we see something interesting,

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,509
we want to make sure that we have enough
power to conclude with high probability

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,640
that the interesting result is,
in fact, statistically significant.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,106
Now, the key thing to keep in mind is
that power has an inverse trade-off

14
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:41,810
with size.

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,320
The smaller the change that you want
to detect, or the increased confidence

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,880
that you basically want to have in
the result, means that you have to run

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,060
a larger experiment, so more page views
in your control and your experiment.
