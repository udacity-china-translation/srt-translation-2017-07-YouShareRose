1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,680
Diane, earlier this lesson you
mentioned learning effects.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,150
Can we talk about those some more?

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,470
First remind me what they are?

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,200
>> Sure.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,510
So learning effects is basically when
you want to measure user learning.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,980
Or effectively whether a user
is adapting to a change or not.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,120
Now we had briefly mentioned these back
in lesson one where we talked about

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,940
two different types of learning effects.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,580
Change aversion, where when users first
see a change they're like, what is this?

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,160
I don't like anything.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,840
Or a novelty effect which
is the exact opposite.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,070
Oh, this is a new thing.

13
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:27,600
What's going on?

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,500
Let me try everything around.

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,510
Now, in both situations, what happens is
that when a user first sees a change,

16
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,510
they're going to tend to react
in one of these two ways.

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,600
But over time they're going to probably
plateau to a very different behavior.

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,660
Now, the key issue with trying to
measure a learning effect is time.

19
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,710
It takes time for you just to actually
adapt to a change and often times

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,260
you don't have the luxury of taking
that much time to make a decision.

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,180
>> Okay, but
if you do have that much time to spend,

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,020
is there anything to keep in mind?

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,300
>> Sure, there's a bunch
of things to keep in mind.

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,170
Now one of them I mentioned earlier in
this lesson which is choosing the unit

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,910
of diversion correctly.

26
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,960
If you want to measure user learning,

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,940
you need a stateful unit of diversion
like a cookie or a user ID.

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,810
The second issue that we want
to take into account is that

29
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,070
because a lot of the learning is
based on not just a slight time but

30
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,220
how often they see the change so
we call that a dosage.

31
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,210
Then you probably want to be using a
cohort as opposed to just a population.

32
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,210
And so you would choose a cohort
in both the experiment and

33
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,110
the control based on either how long
they've been exposed to the change or

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,150
how many times they've seen it.

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,990
Now the last issue is a question
about both the risk and duration.

36
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,660
Right?

37
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,000
From a duration perspective,

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,630
because you want to measure a learning
effect, this is going to take

39
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,420
some amount of time to basically
see what's going to be happening.

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,870
Now, the other thing though,
is that it's going to take a long,

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,740
a long period of time.

42
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,380
You don't want to be
putting a lot of your users

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,060
through a change that you're testing
over a long period of time because

44
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,030
maybe you end up testing other changes.

45
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,774
Now, the other thing is one about risk.

46
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:05,280
If you're actually wanting to measure
a user learning effect, that means that

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,524
you're probably a little uncertain
about what the effect is going to be,

48
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:10,955
which means that it's probably
a higher risk change.

49
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:13,856
Now, both of those mean that you're
probably going to want to run it

50
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:17,275
through a small proportion of your
users for a longer period of time.

51
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,195
>> That makes sense, and
is there anything else you would do?

52
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,615
>> Well, we've done a lot at Google,

53
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,945
because we've done a lot of
looking at sort of user learning.

54
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:26,835
Is that we've developed methodology
where we use both pre-periods and

55
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:27,741
post-periods.

56
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:31,960
Now, both pre-periods and post-periods
are, those uniformity trials.

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,170
There's a versus a test that we
discussed back in lesson three.

58
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,160
But what we're doing is instead of
using it across the entire system,

59
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,850
we're using it in a way that's specific
to your experiment and your control.

60
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,650
And so what happens is that before
you run your A/B test on your

61
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,450
experimental control, and you have those
populations, you're on a pre-period on

62
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,950
the exact same populations but they're
receiving the exact same frequence.

63
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,100
It's an A versus A test
on the same set of users.

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,920
And what happens in the pre-period is
that if you measure any difference

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,260
between your experiment and

66
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,470
your control populations that
difference is due to something else.

67
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,758
Maybe system variability,
user variability, things like that.

68
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:11,770
Now a pre-period I would note,
is useful not just for

69
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,370
when you want to test user learning,
but sort of across the board.

70
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,780
So that you know that any difference
that you measure in your experiment and

71
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,540
control is due to the experiment, and

72
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,400
not due to any preexisting and
inherent differences in your population.

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,660
Now, that's what a pre-period is,
and that basically says, okay,

74
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,260
I don't have any differences
in my populations.

75
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,120
A post-period is saying,
after I run my experiment,

76
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,610
my control, I'm going to run
another A versus A test.

77
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,230
And then, what,

78
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,890
what we can say is that if there are any
differences in the experiment and

79
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,800
the control populations after I've run
my experiment, then I can attribute

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,540
those differences to user learning that
happened in the experiment period.

81
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,290
And so, that's what we basically do.

82
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,850
Now, the key thing that
I sort of note is that

83
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,360
these are pretty advanced techniques.

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,810
If you're really trying to measure user
learning, hopefully you've run tens,

85
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,700
if not, hundreds of experiments already.

86
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,330
If not, I'd probably stick to
some of the simpler techniques.
