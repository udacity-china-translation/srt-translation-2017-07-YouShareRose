1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,469
Now we've gone over some techniques for
getting to a high level concept for

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,480
a metric, and then translating that
into a specific data measurement, and

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,670
also evaluating possible filters.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,430
And a while ago you also
mentioned summary metrics.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,580
What are those?

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,790
>> Well so what we have so
far are direct data measurements.

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:22,110
This can be a page view, a click measure
of latency for a particular event.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,570
And what we want to do,
at this point is,

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,110
to summarize all of these individual
events into a single summary metric.

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,520
Now in some cases,
the summary metric is really obvious.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,590
For example, if you're counting how
many cookies are visiting the homepage,

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,800
it's a count, or
a sum of just the total count, right?

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,440
You can also summarize that further
into something like, you know,

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,990
the average number of visitors per week.

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,690
Now for a rate or a probability,

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,650
if you actually look at the specific
computation, it's actually computing

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,830
an average over the clicks per page
view for every single individual effect.

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,720
Now in all of those cases,

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,885
the summarization is actually
part of the metric definition.

20
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:04,190
But there's a whole bunch of other
cases where you actually have a choice

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,390
of summary metric.

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,810
>> Okay.
What are some examples of that?

23
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,640
>> Well the primary
situation that that occurs,

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,430
is when your per event
measurement is itself a number.

25
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,380
And this is something like the load time
of a video, or how many terms are in

26
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,190
a query, or what the position of
the first click on the page is.

27
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,710
Now when you have a number like that,

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,520
you have a whole set of
metrics to choose from.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,730
For example, the mean, the median, the
25th percentile, the 70th percentile,

30
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,060
the 90th percentile.

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,540
You can choose any of those types
of metrics to actually summarize

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,280
your individual events.

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
>> So how would you choose
between these different options?

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,140
>> Well so what you're going to do is,

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,900
you're going to establish a few
characteristics for your metric.

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,870
The first one is going to be
the sensitivity and robustness.

37
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,340
You want your metric to be sensitive
enough, in order to actually detect

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,090
a change when you, when you're testing
your possible future options, right?

39
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,790
The second that you're going to want to
characterize is what the distribution

40
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,400
of your metric looks like, and
that's going to help you choose.

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,890
>> Okay.
Can you elaborate on that?

42
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,350
What kind of things do I need to do
to characterize the distribution?

43
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,550
>> The most ideal way of doing this is
to do a retrospective analysis, and

44
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,030
to compute a histogram.

45
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,240
Now what a histogram is,

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,750
is that on the x axis you have all of
the different values for your metric.

47
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,444
So for example, you're going to
have all the different values for

48
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:23,431
load time on the x axis.

49
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:25,830
The y axis is going to be the frequency,

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,660
so how often individual events
have that particular load time.

51
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,700
When you actually plot that histogram,

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,340
you get a shape,
that's going to be your distribution.

53
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,760
And what you're looking
at is what that shape is.

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,990
If it's a very normal shape,
then a mean or

55
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,710
median's going to make a lot of sense.

56
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,200
As it becomes more one sided, or
lopsided, you might want to go more for

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,340
a 25th, or a 75th, or a 90th percentile.

58
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,440
That's going to also depend a lot

59
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,740
on what change it is that
you actually want to test.

60
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,210
Now I think you're going to be going
over these, some of the simple ones,

61
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,140
in much more detail, in the next video.

62
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,900
And in the Instructor's Note we
have a lot more details about

63
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,700
some of the other
distributions that can occur.

64
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,430
>> Okay.

65
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,220
And do you have any general
categories of metrics that you

66
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,460
like to keep in mind?

67
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,250
>> There's four categories
that I like to keep in mind.

68
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,200
The first one are the sums and counts.

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,020
This is, like,
how many cookies visit the homepage.

70
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,820
The second one is going to be all of
the distributional metrics: the means,

71
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,240
the medians, the 25th,
the 75th and 90th percentiles.

72
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,020
The third category is going to
be probabilities and rates.

73
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,250
We've talked about those a lot
in these past couple of lessons.

74
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,300
And the fourth one is ratios.

75
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,710
Ratios are very, very useful, because
they can compute a whole range of

76
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,180
different business models, and various
different things that you may care

77
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,810
about, but they can be very
difficult to characterize.

78
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,480
>> Okay.

79
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,800
Let's go over an example before we
move on to sensitivity and robustness.
