1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,130
In the first case, there is probably
no new information being collected,

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,820
since the newsletter sign-ups were
already being stored by user ID.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,640
As long as the original data collection
was approved, this should be fine.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,550
The second case though,

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,790
depends on exactly how the email
addresses are being stored.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,030
The most natural implementation
would be to store them by cookie,

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,180
since the diversion is by cookie.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,500
That would make those
cookies non-anonymous,

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,960
which potentially impacts any other
data that is being collected.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,780
For example, if another experiment is
storing data by cookie that you wouldn't

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,080
want re-identified, then that data has
now become linked to an email address.

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,622
Thus it would be good to seek out
additional review for this experiment.

13
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,540
This is a pretty subtle point, but
in general, you to watch out for

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,608
what whether you are accidentally
identifying data that would otherwise

15
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:45,810
have been anonymous.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,440
The third case does not
require an additional review.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,120
Storing clicks by cookies
is not a problem and

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
is probably already being
done else where on the site.
