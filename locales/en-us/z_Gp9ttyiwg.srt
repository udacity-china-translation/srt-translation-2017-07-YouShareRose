00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,060
Which of the following
experiments are risky enough that

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,760
Audacity might want to limit
the number of users who are exposed?

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,930
That is, for which experiments do
you think it would make sense to

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,460
run the experiment for longer, but
expose fewer total users to the change?

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,720
First, suppose Audacity changes
the database they're using in their

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,850
back end.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,300
Second, consider the experiment
from lesson one,

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,050
where Audacity changed the color
of the start now button.

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,170
How risky was this experiment?

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,630
Next, suppose Audacity tests
changing the account creation.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,540
Before, each user had to create
an account with a new password, but

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,570
now Audacity tests
allowing Facebook login.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,320
Finally, what if Audacity
tests changing the order of

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,300
the courses on the course list page?

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,230
For each change, check the box if you
think this is a high enough risk change

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,050
to limit the number of
users who are exposed.
