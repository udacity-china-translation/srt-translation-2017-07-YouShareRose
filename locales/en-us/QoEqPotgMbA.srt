1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,250
To establish that our results
are statistically significant using

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,770
hypothesis testing,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,320
you need to calculate how likely it is
that your results are due to chance.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,200
In order to calculate this probability,
you need to have a hypothesis about what

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,830
the results would be if your
experiment had no effect.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,650
In the Audacity example,
we'll collect two samples.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,480
A control group with the orange button,
and

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,570
an experimental group
with the pink button.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,860
We've already assumed that each group
follows a binomial distribution, but

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,560
the probabilities might be different for
the two groups.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,210
I'll call the probability that someone
in the control group clicks Pcont for

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,002
control, and the probably that someone
in the experiment group clicks Pexp for

13
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,650
experiment.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,350
This potentially gives two
different distributions.

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,580
If changing the button
color had no effect,

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,680
then we would expect the two groups
to have equivalent distributions, so

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,490
they would right on top of each other.

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,940
In other words, p control and
p experiment would be equal.

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,210
Another way of saying this would be that
p experiment minus p control equals 0.

20
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,360
This hypothesis of what our results
would look like if the experiment had no

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,250
effect is called the null hypothesis.

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,849
And it is also represented as H naught.

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,980
We also need a hypothesis about
the results if the experiment does

24
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,020
have an effect.

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,410
This is called the alternative
hypothesis or HA.

26
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,770
In this case, if changing the button
color does have an effect,

27
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,120
we expect the P experiment minus
P control is not equal to zero.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,910
Once we've defined these hypotheses,
we can estimate p control and

29
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,510
p experiment from
the data we've collected.

30
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,510
Then we'll calculate
the difference between these,

31
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,390
and compute the probability that this
difference would have arisen by chance,

32
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,460
if the null hypothesis were true.

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,740
Then we want to reject the null
hypothesis, and conclude that

34
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,610
our experiment has an effect if
this probability is small enough.

35
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,990
This is the same type of significance
threshold as a confidence interval, so

36
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,790
it make sense to choose the same cutoff.

37
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,000
Thus, we'll choose
the same cutoff as before.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,520
And reject the null if this
probability is less than 0.05.

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,470
This cutoff is also called alpha.

40
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,520
Now, suppose you're running
an experiment where you have

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,600
changed the checkout flow of
an online shopping website.

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,420
You test the effectiveness of your
change by running an experiment

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,240
where some users check out using the old
flow, and some using the new flow.

44
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,280
For each group,
you measure the proportion, or

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
the probability who successfully
complete the checkout.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,420
What null and alternative hypothesis
would you choose for this experiment?

47
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,260
There could be multiple valid answers,
but

48
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,640
choose a formulation that
you think would work.

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,210

Then read the response of
the person above you in the thread,

52
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,240
compare their answer to yours, and
