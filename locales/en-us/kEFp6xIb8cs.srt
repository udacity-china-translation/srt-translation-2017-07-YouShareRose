00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,280
Like Kerry said,

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,250
if you think you can identify
what population will be affected

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,109
by your experiment, you might want to
target your experiment to that traffic.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,270
That is, only run your experiment
on the affected traffic.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,610
Let's take a look at how this can
affect the variability of your metric.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,470
Just like you saw that changing
the unit of diverging can change

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,690
the empirical estimate of variability,

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,630
filtering your traffic can
change the variability as well.

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,943
For example, suppose you want to control
the change that will only affect users

10
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,510
in New Zealand to see whether it
increases click-through probability.

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,900
You run the experiment and looking only
at the New Zealand data, you find that

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,920
there were 6021 unique visitors in
the control group, 300 of whom clicked.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,740
There were also 5979 users in the
experiment group, 374 of whom clicked.

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,030
Based on this and using
the equations you saw in lesson one,

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,920
the estimated probability of
a click in the control group or

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,407
the baseline probability is about 5.1%.

17
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:55,990
The estimated probability in
the experiment group is 6.3%.

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,570
And the pooled standard error is 0.0042.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,080
Now suppose you had
analyzed the global data

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,400
instead of just the New Zealand data.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,280
Since the change doesn't affect
other traffic, let's say for

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,590
the sake of simplicity that in
all the non-New Zealand traffic,

23
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:17,250
there were 50,000 users in each group
and 2,500 of them clicked in each group.

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,800
Now, for the global data,
which includes both the other data and

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,130
the New Zealand data added together,
what would be the pooled standard error?

26
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,580
Is this higher or
lower than the pooled standard error for

27
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,230
just the New Zealand data?

28
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,160
Write your answer in this
box to four decimal places.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,510
Also, is there a statistically
significant difference at alpha

30
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,920
equals 0.05 in New Zealand?

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,230
How about globally?

32
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,840
Select yes or no in each case.
