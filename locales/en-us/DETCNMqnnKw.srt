1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,090
So, we've seen how important
it is to precisely define what

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,490
data you need to compute your metric.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,990
What other issues come up?

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,650
>> Well, for one thing, you often see,
sort of abuse on your site,

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,555
such as spam or fraud, and
you want to try to filter that out.

6
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:17,875
For example, if you have a competitor,
who's looking for your site clicking on

7
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:21,915
absolutely everything, that's data you
may not want to use in your experiment

8
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:25,837
or you may even have someone malicious
trying to mess up your metrics.

9
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:28,767
Now, for a big change,
if you're a big company too,

10
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:32,616
if you have a change in an experiment,
you might actually get blog coverage for

11
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,667
that, and so you could potentially get
a lot of traffic that's just coming to

12
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:40,767
look at the experiment and you'd like
to be able to at least identify that.

13
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:42,987
Ideally, you'd be able to filter it out,
but

14
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:45,570
you want to at least flag
the issue when it comes up.

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,380
>> So there's a bunch of external
reasons as to why you might want to

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,430
filter your traffic.

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,760
There's a bunch of
internal reasons as well.

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,760
So, one example is,

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,620
what happens if your change only
impacts a subset of your traffic?

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,998
For example, maybe you didn't want to
internationalize your change and so

21
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:03,350
it only, only impacts English traffic.

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,580
Or, maybe it only impacts the mobile app
version and not the web version, right?

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,460
And those are situations where filtering
your traffic would actually make

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,820
the most sense because you don't
want to dilute your results, right?

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,390
If you actually filter
just the affected traffic,

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,320
then you can actually increase the power
and sensitivity of your experiment.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,938
>> Now, the goal of all this
filtering is to de-bias your data, or

28
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:26,279
dull-bias your data.

29
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:28,837
But and often if you're
filtering out spam and fraud,

30
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,040
that's exactly what you accomplish.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,590
You do want to be careful you don't
introduce bias into your data by doing

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,300
the filtering.

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,780
So for example, if you have a metric
that can only be measured on logged-in

34
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,290
users, you might actually be biased

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,320
in your data because there's
a bunch of sort of noncommittal or

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,220
newer users trying to use the site who
maybe haven't created an account yet.

37
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,830
So that's a good example.

38
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,550
The most common thing that comes up that
we see is people who are filtering out

39
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,800
especially long or
weird sessions of user behavior.

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,830
Now, that may be a totally legitimate
thing to do, but before you do that,

41
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,620
you want to check and make sure it's not
actually your website, your metric, or

42
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,900
even your logging that's causing
these sessions to come up.

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,139
>> So, how would you check?

44
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,860
If you got some filter
that you're considering,

45
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,700
how do you decide whether to use it?

46
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,830
>> Realistically in most cases,

47
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,710
you're computing a baseline value for
your metric.

48
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,750
One way to actually figure out whether
or not you're biasing or de-biasing your

49
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,120
your data by applying these filters,
is to actually slice your data.

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,130
And what this basically means
is that you're computing

51
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,460
your metric on a bunch of disjoint sets.

52
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,330
So for example, by country, or
by language, or by platform.

53
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,440
What you're going to do in that
situation is you're going to complete

54
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,500
your metric on all of
these different slices.

55
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,570
And then when you look at the filter,
what you want to see is whether or not

56
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,360
you're moving traffic disproportionately
from one of these places or not.

57
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,710
Now, if it is, and

58
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,240
it makes sense because let's say all
of your spam coming from, you know,

59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,600
Berzerkistan or some other country,
then that might be a good thing.

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,140
But if you're actually moving
disproportionately from one of

61
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,734
these places,

62
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:06,840
it may be an indication that you're
actually biasing your results further.

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,130
>> Now, along those same lines,
sometimes looking at week over week or

64
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,710
day over day data or
slicing down to an individual user group

65
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,910
is a great way to identify spam or
fraud, because often you'll

66
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,650
get requests from a single IP address,
or they'll come all at once.

67
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,910
And so looking at week over week or
day over day traffic pattern changes is

68
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,050
a good way to spot something that
looks at least a little unusual.

69
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,610
>> The key thing to remember,
when you're doing all of this

70
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,830
type of analysis about whether or not
you're going to filter your traffic or

71
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,100
not, what you're really doing is,
you're building intuition.

72
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,395
You have to know what changes are
going to be expected versus unexpected,

73
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:44,155
so that you can determine,
when you actually see the data for

74
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:46,725
your real experiment,
do I have a problem?

75
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,165
Do I believe this?

76
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,265
What's really going on?
