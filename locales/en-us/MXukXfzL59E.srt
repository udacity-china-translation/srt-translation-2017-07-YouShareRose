1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,277
Like Carrey said,
you might want to use a cohort,

2
00:00:02,277 --> 00:00:04,730
depending on the type of
problem you are looking at.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,930
A cohort makes more sense than
looking at the entire population,

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,280
if you're looking for learning effects,
if you're examining user retention,

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,930
if you want to increase user activity,
or

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,900
anything else that requires the user
to be established for some reason.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,030
Going back to the Audacity example,

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,200
here's a situation where they
might need to use a cohort.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,290
Suppose they have an existing course
that's already up and running.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,830
Some students have completed the course,
other students are midway through, and

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,930
there are students who have not yet
started.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,460
They want to try changing
the structure of one of the lessons

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,600
to see if it improves the completion
rate of the entire course.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,170
Now, because they want to see,
what happens throughout the course where

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,540
students can pause or
unpause the lessons,

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,976
switch devices, etc., the unit of
diversion will need to be a user-id.

17
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:51,180
That said, it doesn't make sense
to just run the experiment on

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,990
all the users in the course.

19
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,251
To see that, suppose that this blue
line shows the time that students start

20
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:59,840
the lessons that Audacity is changing
with later times to the right.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,930
Each purple dot represents a user or
student.

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,900
So, at this time four students
started the lesson at the same time.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,253
Now, suppose that Audacity starts
running the experiment at this time, for

24
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:12,810
students who started
the lesson a while ago,

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,360
they may actual have
finished the lesson already.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,290
So, they're already past that lesson,
and

27
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,480
they're not even going
to see the change.

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,940
So, taking this whole
population of user-ids, and

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,370
running the experiment on them,
isn't what Audacity wants.

30
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,550
Instead, it would make sense to use
a cohort, and only include users who

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,790
started the lesson after the experiment
was started in the experiment.

32
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,130
That is, it's a subset of
the population, who have the shared

33
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,610
experience of receiving the new lesson,
and not seeing the old lesson.

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,800
Now, for the control, Audacity needs
to create a comparable cohort.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,650
They can not just use these users,

36
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,350
who are not included in the experiment
as the control because there may have

37
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,600
been other system changes in that
time that affected the new users.

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,580
So, instead, Audacity will need to split
this cohort into an experiment cohort

39
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,120
and a control cohort, so

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,660
that they all have the same timing
of when they started the lesson.

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,840
Now, in this example,
we chose a cohort based on time, but

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,000
you could also use other
factors to create a cohort.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,770
Just like running your experiment only
on New Zealand, using a cohort is

44
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,910
limiting your experiment to
a subset of your population.

45
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,400
Thus, in the same way,

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,190
using a cohort can affect
the variability of your metric.
