1
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:02,468
Okay.
Suppose you're considering another

2
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:06,191
experiment and you've computed the size
needed to be 1 million pageviews,

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:08,440
split across control and
experiment groups.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,644
If your average traffic per
day is 500,000 pageviews,

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:15,270
then even if you split all of your
traffic evenly between the control and

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,030
the experiment groups, you'll need
to run the experiment for two days.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,933
However, is your traffic
really the same everyday?

8
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:25,709
It's more likely that you have some
weekly variation such as in this graph,

9
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:29,193
where the traffic is lower on
the weekends and higher on the weekdays.

10
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:31,423
And if you look at your
metric of interests,

11
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:35,058
you might see a variation in that based
on what day of the week it is also.

12
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:38,538
In such a case, you should run on
a mix of weekend and weekday days.

13
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,703
That is you wouldn't want to just
run the experiment on two weekdays.

14
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:46,099
And then you might need to run for
three days rather than two to get enough

15
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:48,943
traffic, since the weekends
don't have as much traffic.

16
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:52,258
And if the change is risky enough
that you don't want to expose

17
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:56,335
such a large percentage of your traffic
to it, you might run for longer say,

18
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:59,670
seven days with a lower percentage
of your traffic diverted.
