1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,400
The shuffled cards are not independent.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,330
Since each card appears in the deck
exactly once, as you draw each card,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,570
it gives you information
about the next card.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,930
If the first card is black,

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,410
the second is slightly less
likely to be black, and so on.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,300
If your deck were infinitely large,
that wouldn't be a problem, but

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,410
drawing 20 out of 52 cards
is a pretty big fraction.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,130
The die rolls are independent.

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,640
The probability of success is
one-sixth rather than one-half, but

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,800
the probability doesn't
have to be a half for

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,880
the binomial distribution to apply.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,870
The events just need to be independent.

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,640
And in this case,

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,800
each die roll doesn't affect
the outcome of the other die rolls.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,440
The search engine case
is not independent.

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,640
Often, if someone doesn't find what
they want the first time they search,

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
they'll immediately search again
with slightly different words.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,940
Those are two separate events,
but they're not independent.

19
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,615
You would expect the results
to be related in some way, but

20
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,517
you can't necessarily tell that
they came from the same user.

21
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:54,694
The education case is probably
not exactly independent, but

22
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:56,210
it's a lot closer.

23
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,110
Each student corresponds to only
one event, not multiple events, and

24
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,740
Udacity students are spread
out all over the world.

25
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,140
You wouldn't expect two different
students to be terribly related.

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,660
Of course, there are exceptions.

27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,710
Maybe some students create two accounts,
in which case,

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,870
we wouldn't know that it's
two different students.

29
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,040
Or maybe some take courses with
their friends, in which case,

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,780
whether they complete would be
correlated, but in practice,

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,570
it would probably be reasonable to
assume a binomial distribution here.

32
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,060
The shopping cart case
is also not independent.

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,020
For example, one person could
add several items to their cart,

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,460
then purchase all of them.

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,840
The outcome for these different
events was highly related.
