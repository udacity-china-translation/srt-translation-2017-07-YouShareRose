1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,100
We have talked about how to choose
both our unit of diversion and

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,050
our population.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,980
What's next?

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,350
>> Next, we have to actually
size our experiment and control.

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,288
Now, the key thing to keep in mind is
that this is an iterative process.

6
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:14,040
What we're going to do is we
are going to try out some decisions for

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,990
our unit of diversion and our
population, see what the implication is

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,150
on both the size as well as
the duration of our experiment.

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,830
And then if we don't
really like those results,

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,170
we'll need to revisit our decisions and
iterate.

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:25,750
>> Sounds good.

12
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,860
Where do we start?

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,660
>> Well, it makes sense to start
with the sizing process, and

14
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,790
we'll look back at what we
learned in lesson one, and

15
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,970
then revisit it based on what
we've talked about since then.

16
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,890
>> From there we'll discuss some of
the other design considerations,

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,750
what the duration of the experiment is,
what the risk factors are and

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,030
all of those types of decisions.
