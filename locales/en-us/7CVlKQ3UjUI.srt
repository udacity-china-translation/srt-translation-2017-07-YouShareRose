1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,150
All right, now we'll go through
an example of how to actually check

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,370
an invariant and see whether it's
reasonably close between the control and

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,740
experiment groups.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,320
Let's say you run an experiment for
two weeks, and

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,280
your unit of diversion is a cookie.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,740
So, the first sanity
check you want to do

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,240
is to see whether the number of
cookies in the control group

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,820
is roughly the same as the number
in the experiment group.

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,430
So you get the number of cookies
in each group in each day and

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,830
the results look like this.

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,980
This column has the number of cookies
in the control group for week one.

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,520
This has the number of cookies
in the experiment group.

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,159
And this table is the same numbers but
for week two.

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,900
Now the first thing I'll do is compute
the total number of cookies for

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,760
each group, and
see if the overall division looks even.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,060
If so, great.

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,570
If not, then I'll look at
the day by day breakdown.

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,480
It turns out that the total number of
cookies in the control group is 64,454,

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,870
and the total for
the experiment group is 61,818.

20
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,920
Now, there are more cookies in the
control group than the experiment group.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,268
But, the question is,
is this within what we expect?

22
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:01,790
Ignoring the day-by-day data for a
minute, how would you figure out whether

23
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,709
the difference between the total
number of cookies in the control and

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,430
experiment groups is
within what you expect?

25
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,880
Remember, each cookie is randomly
assigned to the control group

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,150
with probability 0.5, and to the
experiment group with probability 0.5.

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,940
So, the question is whether
it's surprising that out of

28
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,090
the total number of cookies, 64,454
were assigned to the control group.

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,480
Take a few minutes to think about
how you would solve this problem and

30
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,900
write the steps you would
take in plain English.

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,110
Then share how you would solve
the problem on the forums.

32
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,430
Again, take a minute to read the post
left by the person before you and

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,160
compare their steps to yours.
