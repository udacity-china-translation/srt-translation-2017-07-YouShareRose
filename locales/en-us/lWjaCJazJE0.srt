1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,820
Number of events would be a good
population sizing invariant.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,860
Number of cookies and number of signed
in users would be good as well, for

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,600
the same reasons as before.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,110
Cookies are being
explicitly randomized over.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,510
User IDs are typically
larger than cookies,

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,840
in the sense that one user ID can
correspond to multiple cookies.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,510
So user IDs should be
evenly split as well.

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,540
And it's more likely that the events
could end up unevenly split, but

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,970
it's not something you're expecting.

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,310
And it would be good to catch
that if it does happen.

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,750
The click-through rate on the Start Now
button would not be a good invariant.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,370
By adding a sign-in
button to the home page,

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,770
the experiment could affect how many
people click the Start Now button.

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,770
Maybe fewer people would click the Start
Now button if they instead signed in and

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,380
then went directly to a course
they had already started.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,080
The probability that a user enrolls
in a course would not be a good

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,440
invariant either.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,360
Users often enroll in
courses after signing in, so

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,890
changing sign in rates
could affect enrollment.

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,810
The sign-in rate would definitely
not be a good invariant.

21
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,850
This is the exact metric that Audacity
is trying to change in this experiment.

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,410
The video load time would
be a good invariant.

23
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,760
No backend changes were
made in the experiment, and

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,910
the user has no control
over a load time.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,950
So, they can't affect it.
