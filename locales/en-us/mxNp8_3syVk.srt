00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,150
A/B testing in technology,
like many experiments in anthropology,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,230
psychology, sociology and
medicine, are on actual people.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,140
Because of this,

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,514
you need to ensure that the participants
are adequately protected.

5
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:17,615
To explain this, let's go through a few
examples of cases where participants

6
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:19,335
may not have been adequately protected.

7
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:25,455
One famous example from medical history
is the Tuskegee syphilis experiment,

8
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:29,835
where approximately 600 rural
African-American men in Tuskegee,

9
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:31,155
Alabama, between 1932 and 1972,

10
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:36,100
thought they were receiving free
healthcare from the government.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,060
But in fact, they were being cited
regarding the natural progression of

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,700
untreated syphilis.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,060
This study continued even after
penicillin was established

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,110
as a standard treatment for syphilis and

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,080
the men were both not treated and
not informed of a possible treatment.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,680
Another example from psychology
is the Milgram experiment,

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,630
done in the early 1960s,
where Yale professor, Stanley Milgram,

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,820
measured the willingness of studied
participants to obey an authority figure

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,710
who instructed them to administer
electric shocks to a third person.

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,220
That third person was an actor who
simply pretended to be shocked

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,610
with gradually increasing responses and
pleas to stop.

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,670
The question was, how far would
the participants would go in

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,890
causing pain with prompts
from an authority figure?

24
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,560
In both cases, participants were subject
to a high risk for permanent harm.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,100
Untreated syphilis can cost death, and

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,320
participants of the Milgram experiment
may have been damaged psychologically.
