1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,110
If you're doing diversion
based on the user ID,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,310
the user would be assigned to
a group when they first logged in.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,500
And that assignment would not change.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,920
Note that you can't assign the user
to a group based on their user ID

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,390
before they sign in.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,610
That means you wouldn't be able to
run the experiment on this event, so

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,710
it wouldn't be in the experiment
group or the control group.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,640
If you're doing cookie-based diversion,
you'd make a decision when

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,800
the user first visits the home page, and
again when they start the mobile app,

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,630
since they will have a different
cookie on their mobile device.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,920
If the user never clears their cookies,
then this is the answer.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,490
But, they could clear their
cookies at any point,

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,670
meaning that they could be
reassigned at any other point also.

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,260
If you did event based diversion, then
on every single event, you'd re-decide

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,760
whether that event was in the experiment
group or the control group.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,120
And each event could have
a different decision.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,950
If you are doing device
id based diversion,

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,490
then you'd assign the group at
the start of the mobile experience.

19
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,505
Since you don't typically
have device id's for

20
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:59,900
non-mobile devices, you wouldn't
be able to run the experiment on

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,470
the events before the user
switched to their mobile device.
