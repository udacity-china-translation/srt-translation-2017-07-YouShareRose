00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,430
Now that you've seen how to take a first
pass at choosing high-level metrics,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,020
it's time to get some practice.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,480
I'm going to describe some of the
experiments Audacity is considering, and

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,630
for each one, I want you to choose
the metric you think would make the best

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,460
primary metric to
evaluate that experiment.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,240
The first experiment that Audacity
runs changes the course list page.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,682
Each course has a short
description on this page, and

8
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:24,030
Audacity tests updating
one of these descriptions.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,960
The second experiment is to increase
the size of the Start Now button

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,900
on Audacity's homepage.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,130
And the third experiment is to add
additional text to the site, explaining

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,280
what the coaches do, and what other
benefits come with the paid service.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,700
Now, for each of these experiments,

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,360
I'm going to give you some
metrics to choose form.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,787
Your first choice is
the click-through-rate on the Start Now

16
00:00:42,787 --> 00:00:43,774
button on the homepage.

17
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:47,830
Since the Start Now button is the only
way of progressing from the homepage to

18
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,770
the course list, this metric is also
the rate at which users progress from

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,920
the top level of our funnel we talked
about previously, to the second level.

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,540
The second metric you can choose
is the click-through-probability

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,930
of the Start Now button.

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,310
That is, the probability of progressing
from the homepage to the course list.

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,910
The third metric you can choose is the
probability that a student progresses

24
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,980
from the course list to
a specific course page.

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,930
That's related to the probability
that a user progresses from

26
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,330
the second to the third
level of our funnel.

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,160
But note that it's not quite the same
because this third level is the visit to

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,130
any course page, and
depending on the experiment,

29
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,730
you might want to choose this
to be a specific course page.

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,680
The fourth metric you can choose is
the probability of progressing from

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,960
a specific course to
enrolling in that course.

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,940
Again, this is related to, but not the
same as, the probability of progressing

33
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,210
from this level of the funnel to this
level, since you might want to compute

34
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,140
this metric for a specific course,
rather than across all courses.

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,180
And the fifth metric you can
track is the probability that

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,600
an enrolled student starts using or
paying for coaching, the paid service.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,200
Now, like Diane and Carrie mentioned,
for most experiments,

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,840
you'll actually want to
track more than one metric.

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,690
For this quiz,

40
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,500
choose one of these metrics for each
experiment as the primary metric for

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,265
that experiment, and write the number
of your your choice in these boxes.

42
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,145
Please also discuss on the forums,

43
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:13,575
what additional metrics you would
want to track for each experiment.

44
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:16,475
You might want to track more than
one metric from the list, or

45
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,835
you might think of other metrics
you're interested in tracking.
