00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,610
In the next several videos, we'll be
going over the statistics behind whether

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,220
to be surprised by 150 clicks.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,040
If you're already familiar with
the binomial distribution,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,190
confidence intervals, and
hypothesis testing, then you can follow

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,490
the link in the instructor's
notes to skip past this section.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,970
So, Carrie, how do you know whether
to be surprised by 150 clicks?

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,930
In other words, how do you know how
variable your estimate is likely to be?

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,480
>> Well, there are certain distributions
that commonly arise in statistics that

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,400
can help give you some
good guidelines for

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,049
how variable your data is likely to be.

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,760
If you haven't worked with this before,
something like the bell curve that comes

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,900
up in grades is a good example
of the normal distribution and

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,650
we'll talk about that in a minute.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,900
But for our data here,

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,350
we're going to be using a slightly
different distribution than binomial,

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,950
because instead of having continuous
data, we have successes and failures.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,690
Now, for the binomial, we're in good
shape for this example because we can

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,000
call a click a success and
a no click visit to the page a failure.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,105
It doesn't really matter though.

20
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:03,210
You could also use this distribution
if your data were red and blue, or

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,390
any two exclusive outcomes.

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,090
What matters is, we have exactly two
possible outcomes, click and no click,

23
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,880
and that our metric we're going to
compute with this is a probability.
