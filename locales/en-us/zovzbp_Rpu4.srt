1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,720
Often in A/B testing, you'll find that a
metric you want is difficult to measure.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,990
This can happen because you
don't have access to the data or

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,130
because the metric would simply
take too long to collect.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,640
In the audacity example,

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,120
the last level of the funnel
was how many students get jobs.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,130
And both of these problems
apply to this metric.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,870
Audacity probably doesn't know when
one of its students gets a job.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,670
And even if it did,
getting a job can be a long process.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,000
So, it might not be possible to use
this as a metric for most experiments.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,550
Now I'm going to go over
some additional metrics, and

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,530
I want you to choose which ones you
think would be hard to measure.

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,510
First, suppose Audacity
wanted to measure the rate

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,900
of students returning to
take a second course.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,450
That is, the number of users who
complete one class and then start

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,610
a second divided by the total number of
users who complete at least one class.

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,840
Would this be a difficult metric to use?

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,880
Or what if an online
shopping site like Amazon

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,620
wanted to measure the average happiness
of shoppers who complete a purchase?

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,770
And finally, suppose a search engine
like Google wanted to measure

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,190
the probability that a user finds
the information they were looking for

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,920
within their search results.

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,817
And for each metric check the box,
if you think this metric would

23
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:12,510
be difficult to measure, for
either of these two reasons.
