1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,129
For the Audacity example, we decided to
use click-through-probability instead of

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,770
click-through-rate.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,080
Why, and how do you decide in general?

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,570
>> So generally speaking, you use a rate
when you want to measure the usability

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,460
of the site, and a probability when you
want to measure the total impact, right?

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,310
So if, for example, you want to measure
the usability of a particular button,

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,660
you use a rate because the users have a
variety of different places on the page

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,250
that they can actually
choose to click on.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,780
And so the rate will say how often
do they actually find that button.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,600
Now, if you just want to know how often
users went to the second level page on

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,620
your site, you use a probability,
because you don't want to count if

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,910
users just double-clicked, or did they
reload, or all of those types of issues.

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,170
>> Okay.
And in our example,

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,200
we're interested in whether users
are progressing to the second level of

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,460
the funnel,
which is why we picked a probability.

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,150
>> That's right.

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,210
>> That makes sense.

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,780
So, how will we actually
compute the probability?

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,950
>> So, to compute the probability,
you're going to have to first just work

20
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,492
with the engineers to
modify your website.

21
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,630
They're going to have to
change the website so

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,580
that on every page view
you capture the event,

23
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,810
and then whenever a user clicks
you also capture that click event.

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,510
Now, once you have the data captured,
to compute our rate,

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,510
you just sum the page views,
you sum the clicks and you divide.

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,590
Pretty simple.

27
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,850
For a probability though, you're going
to have to match each page view with all

28
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,980
of the child clicks, so that you count,
at most, one child click per page view.
