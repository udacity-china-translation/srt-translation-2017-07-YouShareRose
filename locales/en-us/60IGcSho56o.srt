00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,480
Let's take a look at an experiment
that tracks multiple metrics.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,330
And suppose that Audacity sometimes
prompts students when they miss quizzes,

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,430
asking if they'd like
to contact a coach.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,720
And they run an experiment that makes
this message appear more frequently.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,190
There are a few different
metrics they could track here.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,020
First, they might track the probability
that a student signs up for

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,767
coaching at any point during the course.

8
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:22,667
Second, they might track how early
in the course students sign up for

9
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:23,680
coaching.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,710
So something like the average amount
of progress a student makes before

11
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,200
enrolling for coaching.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,210
If a student never signs up for
coaching, their progress might be 100%.

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,120
Finally, if coaching
is priced differently,

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,050
depending on how early in
the course the student signs up,

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,380
Audacity might track the average
price paid per student.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,440
If Audacity tracks all three metrics and

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,200
then does three separate significant
tests, with alpha equals 0.05 for each.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,000
Then what is the probability that
at least one metric will show

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,650
a significant difference,
given that there is no true difference?

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,530
In other words, for

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,030
three metrics, what is the chance
of at least one false positive?

22
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,280
To make the problem easier,

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,560
I'll first calculate the probability
that there are no false positives.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,660
That is FP, for
false positive, equals 0.

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,010
The chance that each individual metric
does not show a false positive is 95%.

26
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,828
Now in order for none of the metrics
to have a false positive, the first one

27
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:17,722
can't show a false positive,
which happens with probability 0.95.

28
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:22,390
And neither can the second, so
I need to multiply by 0.95.

29
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,110
And the third can't have
a false positive either, so

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,150
I multiply by 0.95 again.

31
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,205
So the chance that none of the metrics
shows a false positive is 0.95 cubed,

32
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:34,027
which is about 0.857.

33
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:40,086
Then the probability that there is at
least one false positive is 1- 0.857.

34
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:44,280
Which is a 14.3% chance
of any false positive.

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,713
Now I made an assumption
in this calculation.

36
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:48,733
When I multiplied
the probabilities together,

37
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,340
I was assuming that
the metrics were independent.

38
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,816
In fact, this isn't true here.

39
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:56,268
These three metrics are all related and
more likely to move together.

40
00:01:56,268 --> 00:02:01,280
So 14.3% is an overestimate of
the probability of a false positive.

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,150
But assuming independence is an easy
way to get a conservative estimate.

42
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,640
Now suppose you ran an experiment
with ten metrics and

43
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,320
you used a 95% confidence level for
each metric.

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,090
Then what would be
the probability that any of those

45
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,890
metrics would show a false positive?

46
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,830
Or what if you still had ten metrics but
you used a 99% confidence level for

47
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,840
each metric?

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,850
Write your answers in these boxes.

49
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,560
Each should be a number between 0 and
1, not a percent chance.

50
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,570
And you should give each answer
to three decimal places.

51
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,920
Assume that the ten metrics
are independent of each other.
