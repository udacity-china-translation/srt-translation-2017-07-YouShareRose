00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,270
Okay.
Now that we've gone over the history of

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,470
AB testing,
let's start diving into our example.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,440
Throughout this course,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,610
we'll use an example of an online
education company sort of like Udacity.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,710
Let's just call it Audacity.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,900
Audacity is focused specifically
on finance courses, and

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,890
they're trying to test features
that increase student engagement.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,520
First, let's talk about
what a typical user flow

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,700
through the Audacity
site might look like.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,460
You would probably see that the largest
number of users visit the homepage.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,420
Then a subset of those users might
explore the site by looking at a few

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,680
different pages.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,310
An even smaller group
might create an account.

14
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,950
And the final group might
reach some sort of completion.

15
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,320
Maybe they make a purchase, complete
a class, finish a series of classes, or

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,490
share the site on their blog,
for example.

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,635
This type of flow is often
called the customer funnel, and

18
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:48,590
it's a common idea for websites.

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,200
The idea is that you have
the largest number of events at

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,270
the top of your funnel, and
as you go down, it becomes rarer and

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,570
rarer that someone
would reach that level.

22
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,855
The idea is that users
are trickling down the funnel, but

23
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:02,140
that's kind of a simplistic idea.

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,700
Customers don't actually enter,
create an account, and

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,090
then complete a class
in a consistent manner.

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,650
There's a lot of back and forth swirl
between the different states, and

27
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,460
repeat visitors who skip
over intermediate steps.

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,700
We'll be discussing the funnel and
swirl more and

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,255
how it ties to metric
choice in lesson three.

30
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:23,140
For the rest of lesson one, we're going
to go over a simple experiment from

31
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,520
start to finish, so that you can see
all the steps that are necessary for

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,500
running an experiment end to end.

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,690
In future lessons,

34
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,650
we'll be going through several
of the steps in more detail.

35
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,040
We'll consider an experimental
change to Audacity's homepage.

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,460
Specifically, we'll consider
a change to the Start Now button.

37
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,985
If users click this button, they can
see a list of Audacity's courses.

38
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:45,436
In this experiment,
we'll make a simple change,

39
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:48,480
making the Start Now button
pink instead of orange.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,150
So a first pass hypothesis for

41
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,640
our simple experiment is that changing
the Start Now button from orange to pink

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,770
will increase how many students
explore Audacity's courses?

43
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,210
That is, move on to the second
step of the funnel.
