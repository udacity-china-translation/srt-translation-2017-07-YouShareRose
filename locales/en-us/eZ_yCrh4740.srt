1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,350
In the first case, you won't be able
to test this using A/B testing.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,450
People buy cars very rarely, so

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,630
it would take too long to see
if you get repeat customers.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,440
And you don't necessarily even have data
about whether customers are recommending

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,930
the site to their friends.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,270
The second case seems like it
would be easy to A/B test, and

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,510
you certainly could collect data about
user behavior with the new and old logo.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,700
Changing the branding of your company
can be surprisingly emotional for

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,060
your users though.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,390
They might need some time to get used to
the new logo, so you wouldn't want to

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,650
make a decision based on a short time
window of data collected in an A/B test.

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,870
The third case is a great
thing to use A/B testing for.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,460
Once again, there is a clear control and

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,450
experiment, and
choosing good metrics to evaluate this

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,800
type of change will be much easier
than for the first two cases.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,610
You'll probably be able to choose
something like the probability that

17
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,560
the user progresses
past the initial page.
