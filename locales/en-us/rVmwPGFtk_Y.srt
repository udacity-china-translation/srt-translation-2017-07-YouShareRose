1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,020
This course will have five lessons.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,280
In this first lesson, we'll be giving
you an overview of what A/B testing is

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,250
and what it can and can't be used for.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,100
We'll also go over an example
A/B test from start to finish so

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,220
that you can see what
the whole process looks like.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,020
In that example, we'll first
choose a metric for an experiment,

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,490
then review some necessary statistics,
then we'll design our experiment, and

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,380
finally, we'll analyze the results.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,900
Then each subsequent lesson of
the course will dive into more detail

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,920
on a particular part of the process.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
In lesson two, you'll will be
learning about how to protect

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,830
the participants of your experiment,
and what questions you should be

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,630
asking yourself regarding
the ethicality of experiments.

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,090
In lesson three, we'll go into
more detail on choosing and

15
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,560
characterizing metrics to use
when evaluating your experiment.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,450
In lesson four, we'll talk more about
designing your experiment, which

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,460
includes choosing which users go in your
control group and your experiment group.

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,530
And, in lesson five, we'll go over lots
of examples of what your results could

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,440
look like, how to analyze those results,
and how to draw valid conclusions.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,670
Now, you won't need any prior experience
with A/B testing in order to take

21
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,400
this course, because we'll be
covering it from the ground up.

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,520
And you won't need any
programming experience either,

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,700
because this course won't cover how to
implement an A/B testing framework.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,480
It's about how to design and
analyze experiments.

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,440
Introductory knowledge of statistics,
on the other hand, will be required.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,260
So if you need to brush up, check out
the links in the instructors notes.

27
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,070
Now throughout the course,
I'll be going over lots of examples and

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,500
giving you opportunities to
practice what you're learning.

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,410
I'll also be having
conversations with Dianne and

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,930
Carrie about their
experiences in A/B testing.

31
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,550
Let's do that now.
