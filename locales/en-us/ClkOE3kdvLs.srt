1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,820
Now, suppose you are designing
a training program for

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,280
people who run A/B
tests at your company.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,084
Which of the following is
it ethically necessary for

4
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:10,590
anyone who runs A/B test to know?

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,410
Should they know which questions
to consider when evaluating

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,540
the ethics of a proposed test?

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,710
How about the history of A/B testing?

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,750
Or the history of IRBs.

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,790
Should you ensure that they
acknowledge a data policy

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,830
that details what data uses
are acceptable during A/B testing?

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,700
Finally, should you teach them
the principles to uphold when

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,250
running A/B tests?

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,290
Check each that is ethically necessary.
