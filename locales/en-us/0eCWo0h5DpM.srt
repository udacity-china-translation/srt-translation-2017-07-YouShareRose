1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,660
For three metrics and

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:06,557
a confidence level of 95% the answer
was one minus 0.95 cubed.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,650
In general the overall probability
of at least one false positive,

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,670
which I'll call alpha overall, will
be one minus the confidence level for

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,910
that test, raised to the nth power.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,720
The confidence level is equal to
one minus the individual alpha.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,200
And N is the number of
metrics you are measuring.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,050
Again, this formula
assumes independence.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,060
Thus in the first case the answer
is 1 minus 0.95 to the tenth.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,580
Which is 0.401.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,208
And in the second case, the answer
is one minus 0.99 to the tenth.

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,820
Which is 0.096.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,780
So with a 95% confidence level,

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,610
the overall chance of a false
positive is quite large.

15
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,580
Getting close to half, and
even the 99% confidence level

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,850
isn't enough to limit the overall
chance of an error to 5% or less.

17
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,600
It's closer to 10%.

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,860
This plot shows the overall alpha.

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,790
That is, the chance that any metric
shows a false first as the number of

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,070
independent metrics being tested for
three different confidence levels.

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,963
Alpha equals 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01.

22
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:14,040
For alpha equals 0.01 or 0.05.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,590
The over all alpha blows up quickly.

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,990
By the time you have five metrics
with an individual alpha of 0.05.

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,580
Your overall alphas almost a quarter.

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,620
One alpha equals 0.01 or
99% confidence level.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,160
The overall the alpha looks more
manageable by comparison, but like you

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,090
just saw if you have ten metrics you
have a total false positive rate of

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,330
almost 105 and that keeps steadily
going up as you increase to 20 metrics.
