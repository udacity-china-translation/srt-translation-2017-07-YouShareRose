1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,840
Okay, we've talked about user
consistency and ethical considerations.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,580
What's the third thing to keep in mind?

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,920
>> The third thing to keep
in mind is variability.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,180
Now, you might recall
back in lesson three,

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,920
we talked about how to compute
the variability of a metric empirically.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,100
And that the reason why was because
sometimes the empirically computed

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,500
variability was much higher than
the analytically computed variability.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,200
Now the reasoning for this is because
that's what happens when your unit of

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,240
analysis is different than
your unit of diversion.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,920
Now, what's the unit of analysis?

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,010
The unit of analysis is basically
whatever the denominator

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,890
of your metric is.

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,560
So for example, if you're doing
click through rate, and you have

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,130
clicks divided by page views then page
view would be your unit of analysis.

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,940
Now, when your unit of diversion is also
a page view, so as would be the case

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,910
in an event base diversion, then
the analytically computed variability

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,070
is likely to be very close to
the empirically computed variability.

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,860
If, however, your unit of diversion is a
cookie or a user id then the variability

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,040
of your same metric click through rate
is actually going to be much higher.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,700
Sometimes by a factor of four,
five, maybe even more.

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,590
And in those cases you really
want to move to an empirically

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,020
computed variability given
your unit of diversion.

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,440
>> Wow, why does that make
such a big difference?

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,240
>> So what happens is that when you're
actually computing your variability

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,090
analytically, you're fundamentally
making an assumption

26
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,100
about the distribution of the data.

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,720
But you're not just making an assumption
about the distribution of the data.

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,500
You're also making an assumption about
what's considered to be independent.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,590
You're basically doing
these random draws and

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,400
whether they're independent or not.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,577
When you're doing event-based diversion
every single event is a different random

32
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:43,772
draw, and so your independence
assumption is actually valid.

33
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:47,161
Now when you're doing cookie or
user ID based diversion,

34
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:51,520
that independence assumption is no
longer valid because you're actually

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,262
diverting groups of events.

36
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:56,050
And so
they're actually correlated together.

37
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,160
And that will increase
your variability greatly.
