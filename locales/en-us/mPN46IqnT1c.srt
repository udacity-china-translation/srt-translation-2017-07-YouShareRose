1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,490
As mentioned previously, a clear
statement of what data you collect and

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,620
how you use it, is ethically necessary,

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,740
assuming you collect any data
about your users at all.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,230
A history of your company's funding,
on the other hand, is not required.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,910
And while it's probably a good idea for

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,150
most sites to have a navigation bar,
this isn't an ethical requirement.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,010
A list of all experiments
might sounds nice, since then,

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,560
users can be fully informed about what
experimentation they are undergoing.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,980
However, for some experiments,
giving out this information could skew

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,260
your results, and for experiments with
minimal risk that properly protect

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,190
sensitive data,
this measure is not necessary.

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,430
A search bar, like a navigation bar,
might be a good feature for

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,980
many sites to include, but
it's not ethically necessary.
