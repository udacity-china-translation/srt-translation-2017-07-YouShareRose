1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,100
So let's say we go to measure
the click-through probability of

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,600
the start now button.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,610
And we see that 1,000 unique users
visit the Audacity homepage.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,390
And 100 of those visitors clicked
the start now button at least once.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,770
From this data, the best estimate
of the click-through probability

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,630
would be 100 divided by 1000, or 10%.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,320
But, how sure would you
be about this estimate?

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,580
In other words,
suppose you repeated the measurement.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,560
You had a different 1,000
users visit the site and

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,120
again you recorded how many of
them clicked the start now button.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,070
Which results would surprise you?

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,708
Would you be surprised if
you got 100 clicks again?

13
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:37,633
101?

14
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:38,863
110?

15
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:40,082
150?

16
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,719
How about 900?

17
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,685
Check all the answers
that would surprise you.

18
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:47,165
We'll talk later about how
to quantify this, but for

19
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:51,585
right now just check the ones that you
subjectively would be surprised by.
