00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,750
Hi, and welcome to A/B testing.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,730
In this course, we'll discuss how to run
experiments, or A/B tests for businesses

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,280
who have an online presence via
websites or mobile apps, for example.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,910
>> A/B tests allow you to determine
scientifically how to optimize a website

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,860
or a mobile app by trying
out possible changes and

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,551
seeing what performs
better with your users.

7
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:24,380
Using A/B tests means that you
can get data to make decisions

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,160
rather than relying on intuition or
hippos ie,

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,840
the highest paid person's opinion
>> In this course,

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,340
we'll be going over the process
form start to finish.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,060
Everything from deciding what change
you want to test in the first place,

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,990
through drawing a conclusion.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,590
>> On the other hand,
we won't focus on how to implement

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,090
your using A/B testing framework
>> This

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,230
course is about how to design a task,
choose metrics, and analyze the results.

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:46,880
>> Sounds good.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,400
But, before we jump into that, why don't
we take a minute to introduce ourselves?

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,650
>> Sure.
I'm Diane Tang.

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,640
I have a PhD in computer science and
I worked for over 12 years at Google.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,790
I worked on just about every
aspect of experimentation.

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,700
Review from the underlying
infrastructure to designing metrics and

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,800
dashboards to running and analyzing
experiments to the processing culture,

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,380
needed to facilitate
data driven decisions.

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,160
I'll be giving you the practical
engineering perspective

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,980
on how to design and analyze
experiments for a bus decision making.

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,700
>> My name is Carrie Grimes Bostock,
I have a PhD in statistics, and

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,440
I've worked at Google for almost 12
years, in all kinds of different areas.

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,380
I'll be giving you the more statistical
perspective on how you draw

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,600
conclusions in A/B experiments.

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,660
And I'm Caroline Buckey.

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,993
I'm, of course,
a developer at UDacity and before that,

32
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:34,140
I was a software engineer
in Silicon Valley.

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,100
I'll be going over examples,
diving into details and making sure you

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,320
have everything you need to apply
what you're learning on your own
